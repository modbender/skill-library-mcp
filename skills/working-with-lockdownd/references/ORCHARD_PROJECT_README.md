Research into what's accessible on a paired iOS device over WiFi without user interaction.

## Quick Summary

Using only an existing pairing record (from previous iTunes/Finder sync), we can:

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Device fingerprint | ✅ Full | UDID, serial, IMEI, MACs, carrier info |
| Crypto key extraction | ✅ Full | Activation keys, Find My keys, escrow |
| System log streaming | ✅ Real-time | syslog_relay, os_trace_relay |
| Event subscription | ✅ Works | notification_proxy |
| Filesystem access | ❌ Blocked | AFC requires iOS 17 trusted tunnel |
| App installation | ❌ Blocked | Requires trusted tunnel |
| Screenshots | ❌ Blocked | Requires trusted tunnel |

## The iOS 17 Wall

Apple restructured device communication in iOS 17:

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Crypto Extraction
- Activation private key (RSA)
- Find My beacon keys (can track/spoof device location)
- Escrow bag material
- Baseband master key hash

### 2. os_trace Monitoring
- 3.5MB/8sec of system activity
- 34+ processes visible
- 158+ subsystems
- See: WiFi connections, Bluetooth pairing, app activity, security decisions

### 3. iOS 17 Architecture
- New RemoteXPC stack over QUIC
- Trusted tunnel required for sensitive services
- Legacy lockdown still works for diagnostics
- SRP pairing with hardcoded password

## Research Value

This demonstrates the attack surface of iOS WiFi sync:
- **Pairing record = full credential** (stored in `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Lockdown\`)
- Any computer with the pairing record can query the device
- Real-time system monitoring without user knowledge
- Cryptographic secrets accessible over network

## Latest Findings (2026-01-28)

- **SetValue persistence**: Can write arbitrary domain values (JailbreakMode, DisableAMFI, etc.) - they persist but don't affect kernel
- **ConnectionType spoofing**: Can make lockdownd report USB connection over WiFi
- **Security lockout**: Aggressive probing triggers InvalidHostID (device detects abuse)
- **AMFI tracing**: Observed amfid behavior via os_trace - same WiFi wall pattern

See `MAGIC_HUNT.md` for detailed session notes.

## Requirements

- Windows/macOS with existing iOS pairing
- iPhone on same WiFi network
- Python 3.x
- Device UDID (from pairing plist filename)
