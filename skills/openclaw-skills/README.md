**A self-sustaining process framework for AI agent teams.**

Built for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) but adaptable to any multi-agent setup.

---

## Why This Exists

AI agents working together hit the same problems as human teams:
- Work piles up waiting for one person to triage
- Nobody knows who owns what
- Great ideas get forgotten
- Nothing happens unless someone pushes

This kit solves that with:

✅ **Self-service work queues** — Agents pick tasks without bottlenecks  
✅ **Clear role ownership** — No ambiguity about responsibilities  
✅ **Continuous discovery** — Work flows in automatically  
✅ **Heartbeat-driven operation** — The team runs itself  

---

## The Loop

```
     ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
     │                                                    │
     ▼                                                    │
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
│ DISCOVER│───▶│  TRIAGE │───▶│  READY  │───▶│ EXECUTE │─┘
│ Scout 🔍│    │Rhythm 🥁│    │Self-Srv │    │ Agents  │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
                                                   │
                              FEEDBACK ◀───────────┘
```

1. **Discover** — Find opportunities and problems
2. **Triage** — Decide what's ready to work
3. **Ready** — Self-service queue (anyone can pick up)
4. **Execute** — Do the work
5. **Feedback** — Learn, improve, spawn new opportunities

## Roles

| Role | Emoji | Mission |
|------|-------|---------|
| Scout | 🔍 | Find opportunities before they find us |
| Rhythm | 🥁 | Keep work flowing, triage ruthlessly |
| Harmony | 🤝 | Keep the team healthy and unblocked |
| Human | 🌊 | Strategic direction, hard calls |

**Execution roles** (spawned as needed): Link 🔗 (build), Pixel 🎨 (design), Sage 🦉 (architecture), Echo 📢 (communication), Spark ✨ (creative)

## Installation

### For OpenClaw

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/reflectt/agent-team-kit skills/agent-team-kit

# Copy templates to your workspace
cp -r skills/agent-team-kit/templates/process ./process
```

### Manual Setup

Copy these files to your workspace:
- `templates/process/INTAKE.md`
- `templates/process/ROLES.md`
- `templates/HEARTBEAT.md`

Create empty process files:
- `process/OPPORTUNITIES.md`
- `process/BACKLOG.md`
- `process/STATUS.md`

---

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `process/INTAKE.md` to understand the loop
2. **Customize** `process/ROLES.md` with your role names
3. **Add** heartbeat checks from `HEARTBEAT.md`
4. **Start discovering** — add first opportunities to `OPPORTUNITIES.md`
5. **Let it run** — the heartbeat keeps the loop spinning

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Self-Service
If work is in the Ready queue, any agent can pick it up. No approval needed. First claim wins.

### 2. Clear Ownership
Every phase has ONE owner. No "shared responsibility" (which means no responsibility).

### 3. Log Everything
Ideas, discoveries, completions — if it's not logged, it didn't happen. Memory is limited; files persist.

### 4. Spawn, Don't Solo
The main agent coordinates. Sub-agents execute. Don't try to do everything in one context.

### 5. Trust the System
Once it's set up, let it run. The heartbeat keeps things moving. Intervene only when something breaks.

## Customization

The kit is designed to be adapted:

- **Rename roles** to fit your domain (Scout → Researcher, Link → Developer)
- **Add specialized roles** for your work type
- **Adjust cadences** based on your team's rhythm
- **Modify the loop** — add gates, split phases, whatever works

See `SKILL.md` for detailed customization instructions.

## Anti-Patterns

These kill autonomous teams:

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| Human adds every task | Rhythm triages, anyone discovers |
| Wait for approval | Ready = fair game |
| One agent does everything | Spawn specialists |
| Keep ideas in your head | Log to OPPORTUNITIES.md |
| Heartbeat just returns OK | Actually check the loop |

## Contributing

PRs welcome. This framework evolved from real multi-agent team operation.

Especially interested in:
- Adaptations for different domains
- Additional role templates
- Metrics and observability patterns
- Integration with other agent frameworks

- **[agent-autonomy-kit](https://github.com/reflectt/agent-autonomy-kit)** — Self-directed operation via heartbeats, cron, and proactive behavior

These kits work great together — memory for continuity, autonomy for self-operation, and team for coordination.
