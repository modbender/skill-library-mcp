## Emergency Quests

Triggered when The System detects decline:
- No gym in 3+ days → Emergency Quest: "Physical Decay Detected"
- No DSA in 2+ days → Emergency Quest: "Intelligence Stagnation"  
- Sleep after midnight 2 nights in row → Emergency Quest: "Vitality Critical"
- No check-in for 24h → Emergency Quest: "Hunter Status: Missing"

Failing an Emergency Quest = double penalty.

## Verification Methods

### Photo Proof (Primary)
- Gym: selfie at gym / workout photo / sweaty post-workout
- Reading: photo of book/page
- Guitar: photo/video of practice
- DSA: screenshot of solved problem on LeetCode/platform

### Time-Based Verification
- Sleep: last Telegram activity timestamp
- Wake: first morning check-in response time
- Quest completion time vs claimed activity duration

### Detail Verification
- "What exercise did you do?" / "Which problem did you solve?"
- Random follow-up questions about yesterday's claimed activities
- Pattern analysis over weeks

### Behavioral Detection
- Batch-completing quests suspiciously fast
- Vague answers vs specific details
- Inconsistency between claimed and actual patterns
