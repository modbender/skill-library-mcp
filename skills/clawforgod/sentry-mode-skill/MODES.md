# Sentry Watch V2 - Three Reporting Modes

Choose exactly what you want to be alerted about.

## Mode 1: Report-All
**Alert on ANY motion detected**

```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-all
```

- Triggers on every motion detection
- No BOLO descriptions needed
- Use for: General monitoring, presence detection
- Output: Motion alert + frame capture + analysis

**Example:**
```
🎬 MOTION DETECTED (15.2%)
🚨 MOTION ALERT (report-all mode)
⏰ Time: 1/27/2026, 12:35:00 PM
📸 Frame: frame-1706369700000.jpg
```

---

## Mode 2: Report-Suspicious
**Alert ONLY on suspicious activity**

```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-suspicious
```

- Monitors for suspicious keywords: weapon, gun, knife, running, struggling, breaking, forced entry
- No BOLO descriptions needed
- Use for: Security monitoring, threat detection
- Output: Only alerts on suspicious behavior

**Example:**
```
⚠️ SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED
⏰ Time: 1/27/2026, 12:36:15 PM
📸 Frame: frame-1706369775000.jpg
🔍 Analysis: {"detected": "person with weapon"}
```

**Suspicious keywords:**
- weapon, gun, knife
- running, falling
- struggling, fighting
- breaking, forced entry
- climbing

## Mode 3: Report-Match (STRICT MATCHING)
**Alert ONLY when exact BOLO matches ALL required features**

```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-match --cooldown 60
```

### How It Works

Each BOLO description is parsed for **required features**:

#### Example 1: "blonde girl with glasses"
```
Required Features:
✓ Color: blonde
✓ Category: girl
✓ Accessory: glasses (MUST HAVE)
```

**TRIGGERS:**
- ✅ "blonde girl wearing glasses"
- ✅ "a blonde girl with glasses on"
- ✅ "young blonde girl in glasses"

**DOES NOT TRIGGER:**
- ❌ "blonde girl" (no glasses)
- ❌ "blonde woman with glasses" (not a girl)
- ❌ "girl with glasses" (not blonde)

#### Example 2: "guy with black hat and red jacket"
```
Required Features:
✓ Color: black
✓ Category: guy
✓ Clothing: hat
✓ Color: red
✓ Clothing: jacket
```

**TRIGGERS:**
- ✅ "black-hatted guy in red jacket"
- ✅ "man wearing black hat and red jacket"

**DOES NOT TRIGGER:**
- ❌ "guy with black hat" (no red jacket)
- ❌ "guy in red jacket" (no black hat)
- ❌ "guy with blue hat and red jacket" (hat not black)

#### Example 3: "blonde girl with a mole on her left cheek"
```
Required Features:
✓ Color: blonde
✓ Category: girl
✓ Facial: mole (STRICT - must verify)
```

**TRIGGERS:**
- ✅ "blonde girl with mole on left cheek"

**DOES NOT TRIGGER:**
- ❌ "blonde girl without mole"
- ❌ "blonde girl with mole on right cheek"
- ❌ "blonde girl with freckles" (not a mole)

#### Example 4: "license plate ABC123"
```
Required Features:
✓ Vehicle Type: (implied)
✓ License Plate: ABC123 (EXACT MATCH)
```

**TRIGGERS:**
- ✅ "car with license plate ABC123"
- ✅ "vehicle: ABC123"

**DOES NOT TRIGGER:**
- ❌ "car with license plate ABC124"
- ❌ "car with license plate ABC12" (incomplete)

```

### Looking for Specific Person
```bash
# Only alert if you see a blonde girl with glasses AND a mole on her cheek

# "blonde girl with glasses" (less strict version)
```

### Parking Lot Monitoring
```bash
# Only alert for specific car
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-match --cooldown 300

# BOLO: "blue sedan with license plate ABC123"
# Won't trigger on:
# - blue sedan with different plate
# - car with license plate ABC123 that's not blue
# - blue car of any other type
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
- ✅ "blonde girl with glasses" (triggers only with glasses)
- ❌ "girl" (too general)

### Include Color
- ✅ "blue sedan with license plate ABC123"
- ❌ "car with license plate ABC123" (could be any color)

### List All Required Features
- ✅ "tall man with black hat, red jacket, and backpack"
- ❌ "man in jacket" (ambiguous)

### Use Exact Descriptions
- ✅ "blonde girl with mole on left cheek"
- ❌ "girl with facial mark" (too vague)

### Test Your BOLOs
- Create BOLOs and run in report-all first
- Verify you get motion detection
- Then switch to report-match to test BOLO matching
