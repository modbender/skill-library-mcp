# Kamino Positions Monitor

Monitors Solana wallets with Kamino Lend positions. Outputs a liquidation-focused report with health metrics, SOL liquidation price, and how much to deposit or repay to reach 60% margin.

## When to Use

- User asks about Kamino positions, Solana lending, or liquidation risk
- User wants to check fund health or get actionable recommendations
- User mentions "Kamino", "Solana funds", "liquidation", or "DeFi monitoring"

## Prerequisites

The [kamino-positions-monitor](https://github.com/csacanam/kamino-positions-monitor) project must be installed and configured. **User must provide**: Solana wallet addresses in `wallets.json`. RPC is optional—if `SOLANA_RPC_URL` is not set, the public Solana mainnet RPC is used (rate-limited; for heavy use, set a dedicated RPC in `.env`).

1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csacanam/kamino-positions-monitor
   cd kamino-positions-monitor && npm install
   ```
2. Configure: copy `wallets.json.example` → `wallets.json`, add wallet addresses. Optional in `.env`: `SOLANA_RPC_URL`. When run via OpenClaw, the report is delivered to the user's chat automatically. For direct runs (cron, terminal), optional `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` send the report to a Telegram chat.
3. Project path: directory containing `kamino_monitor.js`. Set `KAMINO_MONITOR_PATH` or use `.` if the workspace is the project.

## Run the Monitor

```bash
cd "${KAMINO_MONITOR_PATH:-.}" && node kamino_monitor.js wallets.json
```

## Output

Stdout gets the full report. Via OpenClaw, the agent delivers it to the user's chat. When run directly, optional `TELEGRAM_*` in `.env` also pushes to a Telegram chat (HTML formatting, Jupiter links).
