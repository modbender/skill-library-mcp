# Skill Reviewer Pro

Comprehensive skill review and validation for OpenClaw skills with scoring rubric, defect checklists, functional verification, optimization recommendations, and workflow validation.

## Language Adaptation

**IMPORTANT: Always respond in the same language as the user's request.**

- If user asks in Chinese → respond in Chinese
- If user asks in English → respond in English
- If user asks in other languages → respond in that language

Auto-adapt to the user's language to ensure clear communication and better user experience.

## Review: agent-builder-plus (Example)

### Level 1: Format Validation ✅
- `package_skill.py` validation passed
- YAML frontmatter valid
- File structure correct

### Level 2: Writing Quality Assessment

**Structure:** ✅ Good (6/6)
- Clear frontmatter with name and description
- Well-organized body with workflow sections
- Progressive disclosure pattern used

**Description:** ✅ Strong (8/8)
- Starts with what skill does: "Build high-performing OpenClaw agents end-to-end."
- Includes trigger: "Use when you want to design a new agent..."
- Specific scope: mentions SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- Reasonable length
- Contains searchable keywords

**Example Density:** ⚠️ Low (1/3)
- SKILL.md has few code blocks
- Could benefit from more concrete examples

**Organization:** ✅ Good (6/6)
- Organized by workflow (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4)
- Logical flow from interview to generation to validation
- Sections are self-contained

**Actionability:** ✅ Good (10/10)
- Instructions are imperative
- Steps are ordered logically
- Guardrails checklist provided
- Acceptance tests included

### Level 3: Functional Verification ❌ CRITICAL (0/20)

**Problem:** Generated AGENTS.md template does not match OpenClaw specifications

**Missing from templates.md AGENTS.md:**
- Session startup requirements (Read SOUL.md, USER.md, memory files)
- Memory workflow details (daily notes vs long-term)
- Group chat behavior guidelines (when to speak, when to stay silent)
- Heartbeat mechanism details (heartbeat vs cron, what to check)
- Tool usage guidelines (Skills provide tools, Voice storytelling, Platform formatting)

**Impact:** Skills created with agent-builder-plus will be missing critical OpenClaw agent behaviors.

### Level 4: Best Practices Check ✅ Good (15/15)

**Progressive Disclosure:** ✅ Good (5/5)
- SKILL.md is concise
- Detailed information in references/
- References properly linked

**Resource Organization:** ✅ Good (5/5)
- Only necessary directories created
- No extraneous files

**Triggering Accuracy:** ✅ Good (5/5)
- Description clearly states when to use
- No "When to Use This Skill" in body

### Level 5: Optimization Recommendations

#### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix)

**1. Fix AGENTS.md Template Functional Mismatch**
Update references/templates.md to include all required sections from actual OpenClaw AGENTS.md.

#### 🟡 Major (Should Fix)

**2. Add More Concrete Examples**
Add 3-5 concrete code examples in workflow sections.

**3. Add Quick Start Section**
Add a "Quick Start" section at the beginning of SKILL.md.

### Level 6: Workflow Validation ❌ CRITICAL (0/20)

**Note:** This level applies to workflow tools (skills that guide users through multi-step processes).

#### Workflow Completeness Check

```
WORKFLOW COMPLETENESS CHECK:

[ ] Each phase has clear operational steps
[ ] Correct CLI commands are used
[ ] Error handling is documented
[ ] Backup and recovery mechanisms exist
[ ] Verification steps are included
[ ] Configuration management is documented
[ ] Failure recovery strategies exist
```

**agent-builder-plus Analysis:**

| Check | Status | Issue |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Each phase has clear operational steps | ⚠️ Partial | Phase 2 only lists files, not creation commands |
| Correct CLI commands are used | ❌ Missing | No `openclaw agents add` command |
| Error handling is documented | ❌ Missing | No error handling in any phase |
| Backup and recovery mechanisms exist | ❌ Missing | No backup before config changes |
| Verification steps are included | ❌ Missing | No verification after agent registration |
| Configuration management is documented | ❌ Missing | No auth-profiles.json documentation |
| Failure recovery strategies exist | ❌ Missing | No recovery strategies for any phase |

#### Detailed Issues

**Issue 1: Missing BOOTSTRAP.md in file list**
- **Phase:** Phase 2
- **Problem:** BOOTSTRAP.md is mentioned in AGENTS.md specs but not in file list
- **Impact:** New agents lack first-run guidance
- **Fix:** Add `BOOTSTRAP.md` to Phase 2 file list

**Issue 2: No agent registration logic**
- **Phase:** Missing
- **Problem:** No `openclaw agents add` command documented
- **Impact:** Users must manually configure openclaw.json
- **Fix:** Add Phase 2.5 with `openclaw agents add` command

**Issue 3: No auth-profiles.json documentation**
- **Phase:** Missing
- **Problem:** No authentication configuration documentation
- **Impact:** Agents cannot access external services (e.g., Feishu)
- **Fix:** Add authentication section after Phase 2.5

**Issue 4: No backup mechanism**
- **Phase:** Missing
- **Problem:** No backup before modifying openclaw.json
- **Impact:** Config errors can break entire OpenClaw system
- **Fix:** Add backup step before Phase 2.5

**Issue 5: No configuration verification**
- **Phase:** Missing
- **Problem:** No verification after agent registration
- **Impact:** Agent may not start correctly
- **Fix:** Add Phase 2.6 with verification steps

**Issue 6: No directory creation robustness**
- **Phase:** Phase 2
- **Problem:** No error handling for directory creation
- **Impact:** File writes fail silently if directory creation fails
- **Fix:** Add `mkdir -p` with error checking

**Issue 7: No automated testing (Phase 8)**
- **Phase:** Missing
- **Problem:** Only Phase 4 (acceptance tests), no automated testing
- **Impact:** No complete testing workflow
- **Fix:** Add Phase 8 with automated test commands

**Issue 8: No failure recovery strategies**
- **Phase:** All phases
- **Problem:** No recovery strategies for any phase
- **Impact:** Users don't know how to recover from failures
- **Fix:** Add failure recovery section to each phase

**Issue 9: Unclear Feishu binding method**
- **Phase:** Phase 1
- **Problem:** Question 2 asks "Which channels?" but doesn't clarify Feishu binding
- **Impact:** Users unclear about channel binding vs /agentname command
- **Fix:** Clarify Feishu binding options in Phase 1

**Issue 10: Optional systemd heartbeat**
- **Phase:** Optional
- **Problem:** No systemd service configuration option
- **Impact:** Cannot run agent as systemd service
- **Fix:** Add optional systemd service configuration

---

## Language Adaptation Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Always respond in the same language as the user's request.**

### Detection Rules

1. **Detect user language from the request message**
   - Check the language of the user's input message
   - Use the same language for all responses

2. **Language mapping**
   - Chinese (中文/汉语) → Respond in Chinese
   - English → Respond in English
   - Japanese (日本語) → Respond in Japanese
   - Korean (한국어) → Respond in Korean
   - Other languages → Respond in the detected language

3. **Consistency**
   - Once language is detected, use it for the entire review
   - All section headers, descriptions, and feedback should be in the same language
   - Technical terms (like "Level 1", "Level 2") can remain in English if they are standard terminology

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: User asks in Chinese**
```
User: 请审查一下 agent-builder-plus 这个 skill
AI: (responds in Chinese)
## 审查结果：agent-builder-plus
...
```

**Scenario 2: User asks in English**
```
User: Please review the agent-builder-plus skill
AI: (responds in English)
## Review Results: agent-builder-plus
...
```

**Scenario 3: User asks in mixed language**
```
User: 请审查 agent-builder-plus skill
AI: (responds in Chinese, as the primary language is Chinese)
## 审查结果：agent-builder-plus
...
```

### Implementation Notes

- Language detection should be done at the start of the review
- Use simple language detection (check for Chinese characters, etc.)
- If language cannot be detected, default to the language of the previous interaction
- Maintain language consistency throughout the entire review process

### Technical Terms

Keep technical terms in English when appropriate:
- Skill names (e.g., "agent-builder-plus")
- File names (e.g., "SKILL.md", "IDENTITY.md")
- CLI commands (e.g., "openclaw agents add")
- Technical concepts (e.g., "workspace", "agent", "channel")

But translate descriptions, feedback, and explanations to the user's language.
