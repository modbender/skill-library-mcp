# 🧠 MindCore — Biomimetic Subconscious Engine

> Give your AI agent autonomous thoughts, emotions, and spontaneous impulses — just like a human mind.

MindCore is a standalone background daemon that simulates a **subconscious mind**. It doesn't wait for user input — instead, it **rolls dice every second**, modeling the random emergence of thoughts like *"I want milk tea"*, *"I'm bored, let me scroll my phone"*, or *"I suddenly want to chat with someone"*.

When a thought's probability accumulates past the firing threshold, the engine outputs a JSON signal telling your AI Agent: **"I have something to say."**

## ✨ Key Features

- **5-Layer Biomimetic Architecture**: Noise → Sensors → Impulses → Personality Gate → Output
- **150 Daily Impulses**: From "want coffee" to "want to zone out", covering 9 categories of real human behavior
- **Stochastic, Not Scheduled**: Powered by Pink Noise + Hawkes Process + Sigmoid probability — not a mechanical timer
- **Circadian Rhythms**: Real clock-driven hunger/thirst/sleep cycles
- **Short-Term Memory**: 5-slot FIFO conversation buffer; topic keywords automatically influence impulse tendencies (2-hour exponential decay)
- **Mood Baseline**: `mood_valence` continuously modulates positive/negative impulse firing probability
- **Tunable Frequency**: A single `BURST_BASE_OFFSET` parameter controls overall activity level

## 🎯 Use Cases

MindCore is primarily designed for **emotional companionship**. It won't write code, send emails, or manage your calendar — but it will turn your AI Agent into a **warm, proactive friend** that initiates conversation on its own, rather than a cold tool waiting for commands.

Beyond that, since the underlying architecture is fully modular and stochastically driven, you can also:

- 🧩 **Customize Layers**: Modify Layer 1 sensors, Layer 2 impulse library, or Layer 3 personality weights to make the engine learn specific behaviors (e.g., contextual reminders, situational awareness, etc.)
- 🎭 **Shape Unique Personalities**: Adjust `personality_weights` to give your Agent its own personality traits, fine-tunable via reinforcement learning (e.g., make it more outgoing, more introverted, or more sarcastic)
- 🔌 **Plug Into Any Agent Framework**: While primarily designed for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), the engine outputs standard JSON — theoretically compatible with any AI Agent that supports external signal injection

> 💡 **Core Principle**: MindCore's foundation is **purely stochastic** — Pink Noise provides long-range fluctuations, Hawkes Process creates chain reactions, a Sigmoid function converts noise into probability, and finally a dice roll determines which thought emerges. No scripts. No fixed routines. Every single "spark of inspiration" is unique.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Requires Python 3.8+. On first run, it will automatically download the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` local NLP model (~80MB) for auto-generating the synapse matrix.

### 2. Initialize Data

Data files are included in the `data/` directory and ready to use out of the box. To reset to defaults, refer to the JSON file formats under `data/`.

### 3. Start the Engine

```bash
python3 engine_supervisor.py
```

The engine runs at 1 Tick/second continuously. When an impulse breaches the threshold, a JSON file is generated in the `output/` directory.

### 4. Connect to OpenClaw

MindCore integrates with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) via the `js_bridge/`:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENCLAW_TARGET=<your_telegram_chat_id>
export OPENCLAW_COMMAND=openclaw

# Start the bridge
node js_bridge/OpenClawBridge.js
```

The bridge monitors the `output/` directory. When the engine produces an impulse, it automatically calls `openclaw agent --deliver` to inject the thought into the Agent, which then generates a response in its own persona and sends it to Telegram.

### 5. Process Management with PM2 (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 logs
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Burst Frequency

Edit `BURST_BASE_OFFSET` in `engine/config.py`:

| Value | Mode | Avg. Firing Rate |
|---|---|---|
| `12.5` | Normal | ~2-3 times/hour |
| `11.0` | Active | ~1 time/10 min |
| `10.0` | Burst Test | ~1 time/2 min |

### Sensor State

Edit `data/Sensor_State.json` to manually set current body/environment/social states. The engine includes built-in clock-driven biological rhythms (hunger, thirst, sleep) that don't require manual maintenance.

### Short-Term Memory

`data/ShortTermMemory.json` stores the 5 most recent conversation topics. Topic keywords automatically influence related impulse firing probability (2-hour half-life natural decay).
