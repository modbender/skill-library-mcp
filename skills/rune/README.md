> *Named after Norse runes — secret knowledge carved in stone.*

**🧠 The first self-improving memory system that learns, adapts, and gets smarter over time.**

Transform static memory files into intelligent, dynamic memory that evolves with use. Get **80% token savings**, perfect recall, and truly adaptive AI assistants.

**🔥 Featured on ClawHub** | **⭐ Production-tested with 140+ facts** | **🚀 Zero setup required**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Memory System Integration Required

**WARNING**: Simply installing Rune is insufficient. You must integrate it into your workflow.

### Common Mistake (Our Experience)
❌ Installing the CLI but never using it systematically  
❌ Building memory without workflow automation  
❌ Optional usage that gets ignored under pressure  
❌ **Result: Sophisticated system sits completely unused**

### Required Integration  
✅ Session start hooks that force memory recall  
✅ Automated context injection before responses  
✅ Regular memory maintenance in heartbeat cycles  
✅ Mandatory decision storage during work  

**See `INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` for complete workflow setup after installation.**

## 🌟 Why Rune?

**Before Rune:** AIs forget between sessions, waste tokens on irrelevant context, repeat mistakes  
**After Rune:** Perfect memory, smart context injection, pattern learning, autonomous task management

## Architecture

- **Runtime:** Node.js (ES modules)
- **Database:** SQLite via better-sqlite3 with FTS5
- **LLM Engines:** Ollama (local), Anthropic, OpenAI (for extraction)
- **DB Location:** `~/.openclaw/memory.db`

### Fact Schema

Each fact has:
- **category** — person, project, preference, decision, lesson, environment, tool
- **key** — unique identifier (e.g., `cory.son.name`)
- **value** — the actual fact
- **confidence** — 0.0-1.0
- **scope** — global or project
- **tier** — working (TTL-based) or long-term
- **source_type** — manual, user_said, inferred

## Integration with OpenClaw

Add to your `HEARTBEAT.md`:
```markdown
## Memory Maintenance
- `rune expire` — prune expired working memory
- `rune inject --output ~/.openclaw/workspace/FACTS.md` — regenerate context
- `rune consolidate --auto-prioritize` — optimize memory (weekly)
```

## Automated Maintenance & Cron Jobs

For optimal performance, Rune benefits from regular maintenance. Here are recommended automation schedules:

### Daily Maintenance
```bash
# Add to crontab: crontab -e
# Daily at 3 AM - expire old working memory and regenerate context
0 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/rune expire && /usr/local/bin/rune inject --output ~/.openclaw/workspace/FACTS.md
```

### Weekly Maintenance  
```bash
# Weekly on Sunday at 2 AM - consolidate memory and self-review
0 2 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/rune consolidate --auto-prioritize && /usr/local/bin/rune self-review --days 7
```

### Monthly Deep Cleaning
```bash
# First day of month at 1 AM - pattern analysis and optimization
0 1 1 * * /usr/local/bin/rune pattern-analysis --days 30 && sqlite3 ~/.openclaw/memory.db "VACUUM; ANALYZE;"
```

### Database Backup (Recommended)
```bash
# Daily at 4 AM - backup memory database
0 4 * * * cp ~/.openclaw/memory.db ~/.openclaw/memory.db.backup.$(date +\%Y\%m\%d)
# Keep only last 7 days of backups
5 4 * * * find ~/.openclaw -name "memory.db.backup.*" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Why Automate?
- **🧹 Keeps memory lean**: Removes expired working memory automatically
- **⚡ Maintains performance**: Regular consolidation prevents database bloat  
- **📈 Enables learning**: Self-review catches patterns and improves behavior
- **🔄 Regenerates context**: Ensures FACTS.md stays current with latest facts
- **💾 Protects data**: Regular backups prevent memory loss
