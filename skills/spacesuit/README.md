# 🧑‍🚀 OpenClaw Spacesuit

> *Your AI agent's workspace, suited up for the real world.*

A batteries-included framework scaffold for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) workspaces. When you install OpenClaw, you get an AI agent — but an agent without a workspace is like an astronaut without a spacesuit. This package gives your agent structure, memory, safety, and operational conventions.

## What's Included

- **Session startup protocol** — security-first file loading order
- **Memory system** — daily logs + curated long-term memory with commit discipline
- **Git workflow** — mandatory pre-commit checks, worktree conventions, parallel multi-agent coordination with merge locks
- **Safety rules** — pre-action checklist, destructive-action guards, stand-down protocol
- **Priority system** — P0–P5 triage for tasks and incidents
- **Cross-platform handoffs** — structured context transfer between Slack/Discord/Telegram
- **Heartbeat framework** — proactive periodic checks with state tracking
- **Decision logging** — mandatory audit trail for architectural decisions
- **Meta-learning framework** — expert-first research methodology (Dunning-Kruger aware)
- **Security baseline** — secret transmission policy, prompt injection defense, data classification

## Installation

### Via ClawHub (recommended)

```bash
clawhub install spacesuit
```

This places the package at `<workspace>/skills/spacesuit/`.

### Manual

```bash
cd <your-openclaw-workspace>
git clone https://github.com/jontsai/openclaw-spacesuit.git skills/spacesuit
```

### First-Time Setup

After installation, run the installer to create workspace files from templates:

```bash
cd skills/spacesuit
make init
```

This creates `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, and `Makefile` at your workspace root — each with framework content wrapped in `SPACESUIT` markers and space for your customizations.

### Personalize

```bash
# Edit these files at your workspace root:
vi IDENTITY.md    # Name your AI
vi USER.md        # Tell it about yourself
vi SOUL.md        # Set the personality/vibe
vi TOOLS.md       # Add your tool configs
```

## How It Works

OpenClaw reads hardcoded filenames from the workspace root (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, etc.). Since we can't change that loading behavior, Spacesuit uses **section-based merging**:

1. Framework content is wrapped in `<!-- SPACESUIT:BEGIN -->` / `<!-- SPACESUIT:END -->` markers
2. On upgrade, only the content between markers is replaced
3. Everything outside the markers (your customizations) is preserved

## Upgrading

```bash
cd skills/spacesuit

# See what would change
make diff

# Preview upgrade (no changes)
make upgrade-dry

# Apply upgrade
make upgrade

# Check version
make version
```

```

## Data Layer Scripts

Spacesuit includes utility scripts that gather data for dashboards and tooling:

### sync-operators.sh

Auto-generates `state/operators.json` from session transcripts:

```bash
# Run from workspace
./scripts/sync-operators.sh

# Preview without writing
./scripts/sync-operators.sh --dry-run

# Explicit workspace
./scripts/sync-operators.sh --workspace /path/to/workspace

# Multi-profile support (uses ~/.openclaw-<name>)
./scripts/sync-operators.sh --profile myprofile
./scripts/sync-operators.sh --dev  # shortcut for --profile dev

# Or via environment variable
OPENCLAW_PROFILE=myprofile ./scripts/sync-operators.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Scans OpenClaw session transcripts for user messages
- Extracts Slack user IDs and usernames
- Counts messages per operator
- Preserves manually-set roles across syncs

**Output:** `state/operators.json` — used by [OpenClaw Command Center](https://github.com/jontsai/openclaw-command-center)

**Supported channels:**
- ✅ Slack (`] username (USERID):` pattern)
- 🔜 Telegram, Discord, Signal (PRs welcome!)
