## Currently Learning

## Want to Learn
- Cliffs of Dover — Eric Johnson (way above level, someday)

## 2024-02-15 (45 min)
- Warm-up: chromatic spider, 5 min
- Comfortably Numb: intro bends, slow
- Worked vibrato on sustained bends
- Still inconsistent — need more isolated practice

## 2024-02-14 (30 min)
- Pride and Joy rhythm only
- Shuffle feel improving with click
- Tried at 90% tempo, sloppy — back to 80%
```
