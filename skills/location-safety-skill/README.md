# 🛡️ Location Safety Skill

**Real-time safety monitoring for AI assistants** — because your AI should watch your back.

## Inspiration

This skill was inspired by [Daniel Miessler's](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler) essay **["AI's Predictable Path"](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/ai-predictable-path-7-components-2024)** — specifically Component #4: *"Our DAs Will Become Our Active Advocates and Defenders."*

> *"If they hear something or see something, they'll immediately display something to their owner, or speak it in their ear.*
>
> *Hey—sorry to interrupt—there's a suspected shooter in your area.*
>
> *Take Aiden and go out the back by the bathrooms. There's an exit there. Go out that exit and to the left right now."*

This skill is a first step toward that vision — giving AI assistants the ability to actively monitor their owner's safety and take protective action.

## Why This Exists

Your AI assistant knows a lot about you, but does it know if you're safe?

This skill gives your AI the ability to:
- 📍 **Track your location** via your phone
- 🌦️ **Monitor for dangers** in your area (weather, earthquakes, air quality, breaking news)
- 📱 **Alert you** when something dangerous is detected
- 🚨 **Escalate to loved ones** if you don't respond

### The Problem

You're out and about. A wildfire breaks out nearby. A severe thunderstorm is approaching. There's an active emergency in your neighborhood. 

**How would you know?**

Sure, you might get a push notification eventually. But your AI assistant — the one that's supposed to help you — has no idea where you are or what's happening around you.

### The Solution

This skill creates a **safety loop**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[📱 Your Phone] -->|Location| B[🖥️ Webhook Server]
    B --> C[🤖 AI Assistant]
    C -->|Checks| D[🌦️ Weather APIs]
    C -->|Checks| E[🌋 Earthquake Data]
    C -->|Checks| F[💨 Air Quality]
    C -->|Checks| G[📰 Local News]
    D & E & F & G --> H{Danger?}
    H -->|Yes| I[📱 Alert You]
    H -->|No| J[✅ All Clear]
    I -->|No Response| K[📧 Alert Emergency Contact]
```

## How It Works

### 1. Location Tracking

Your phone sends location updates to a webhook server running alongside your AI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Phone as 📱 OwnTracks
    participant Server as 🖥️ Webhook
    participant AI as 🤖 Assistant
    
    Phone->>Server: POST /location (lat, lon)
    Server->>Server: Save to location.json
    Note over AI: Every 30 minutes...
    AI->>Server: Read location.json
    AI->>AI: Run safety checks
```

### 2. Multi-Source Safety Checks

Every 30 minutes, your AI checks multiple data sources for your current location:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Sources (Free APIs)"
        NWS[🌦️ National Weather Service<br/>Severe weather, floods, storms]
        USGS[🌋 USGS Earthquakes<br/>Seismic activity within 100km]
        AQI[💨 Open-Meteo Air Quality<br/>AQI, PM2.5, smoke]
        NEWS[📰 Local RSS Feeds<br/>Breaking news, emergencies]
    end
    
    subgraph "Safety Check"
        CHECK[🔍 Analyze all sources]
    end
    
    NWS --> CHECK
    USGS --> CHECK
    AQI --> CHECK
    NEWS --> CHECK
    
    CHECK -->|All Clear| OK[✅ Log & Continue]
    CHECK -->|Alert Found| ALERT[⚠️ Trigger Alert Flow]
```

### 3. Alert & Escalation Flow

When danger is detected, the AI doesn't just log it — it takes action:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI as 🤖 Assistant
    participant You as 👤 You
    participant Wife as 👩 Emergency Contact
    
    AI->>AI: Danger detected!
    AI->>You: 📱 WhatsApp: "Safety alert! Are you okay?"
    
    alt You respond within 15 min
        You->>AI: "I'm safe"
        AI->>AI: Clear alert ✅
    else No response after 15 min
        AI->>Wife: 📧 Email: "Sid hasn't responded to safety alert"
        Note over Wife: Can check on you
    end
```

### 4. Self-Preservation

The AI also monitors threats to *itself* — the machine it runs on:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Self-Check"
        DISK[💾 Disk Space]
        MEM[🧠 Memory]
        NET[🌐 Tailscale Status]
        ENV[🌍 Environment<br/>Weather at home location]
    end
    
    DISK -->|>85% full| WARN[⚠️ Alert owner]
    MEM -->|<40% free| WARN
    NET -->|VPN down<br/>but internet up| WARN
    ENV -->|Danger at home| WARN
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** If the internet is fully down, I obviously can't alert you. But I *can* detect partial failures (e.g., Tailscale VPN down while internet is up) and warn you before things get worse.
