---

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create a Browser Profile

LinkedIn Monitor uses Clawdbot's browser tool to check your inbox. You need a browser profile that's logged into LinkedIn.

**Option A: Use the default "clawd" profile**
```bash
# Start the clawd browser
clawdbot browser start --profile clawd

# This opens a Chrome window. Log into LinkedIn manually.
# Keep this browser open — it needs to stay running.
```

**Option B: Create a custom profile**
```bash
# Create a profile named "linkedin"
clawdbot browser start --profile linkedin

# Log into LinkedIn, then keep it open
```

> **Tip:** Put the browser on a second desktop/workspace so it doesn't interfere with your main browsing.

### Step 2: Run Setup

```bash
linkedin-monitor setup
```

This will ask you for:
- **Discord channel ID** — Where to send alerts (right-click channel → Copy ID)
- **Calendar link** — For booking meetings (e.g., cal.com/yourname)
- **Timezone** — Your timezone (e.g., America/New_York)

Configuration is saved to `~/.clawdbot/linkedin-monitor/config.json`

### Step 3: Verify Health

```bash
linkedin-monitor health
```

You should see:
```
Dependencies:
✓ jq installed
✓ Browser profile ready

Authentication:
✓ LinkedIn logged in as: Your Name

Configuration:
✓ Config file exists
✓ Alert channel configured

Automation:
! Cron job not installed — run: linkedin-monitor enable
```

### Step 4: Test Manually

```bash
linkedin-monitor check
```

This runs one check cycle. If you have unread messages, it will report them.

### Step 5: Enable Hourly Monitoring

```bash
linkedin-monitor enable
```

This creates a cron job that runs every hour to check your inbox.

## How It Works

```
Every Hour:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Check browser is running             │
│ 2. Open LinkedIn messaging tab          │
│ 3. Take snapshot of inbox               │
│ 4. Compare against seen messages        │
│ 5. If NEW message:                      │
│    → Draft reply in your voice          │
│    → Alert you on Discord               │
│    → Wait for approval                  │
│ 6. Update state file                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**State is tracked in:** `~/.clawdbot/linkedin-monitor/state/messages.json`

Each message gets a unique ID (`Name_Timestamp`). Once reported, it's added to `seenIds` and never reported again.

## Approving Messages

When a new message arrives, you'll get an alert like:

```
📬 **John Smith**
> Hey, I saw your post about AI automation. Would love to chat!

**Draft reply:**
> Hey John, thanks for reaching out. Happy to connect — what specifically caught your interest?

Reply "send John" to approve.
```

**Commands:**
- `send John` — Send the draft as-is
- `send all` — Send all pending drafts
- `edit John Hey John, let's set up a call...` — Edit and send
- `skip John` — Discard the draft

---

## Configuration

Edit `~/.clawdbot/linkedin-monitor/config.json`:

```json
{
  "autonomyLevel": 1,
  "alertChannel": "discord",
  "alertTarget": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  "calendarLink": "cal.com/yourname",
  "communicationStyleFile": "USER.md",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "schedule": "0 * * * *",
  "browserProfile": "clawd"
}
```

### Supported Channels

| Channel | alertChannel | alertTarget |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Discord | `discord` | Channel ID |
| Telegram | `telegram` | Chat ID |
| Slack | `slack` | Channel ID or name |
| WhatsApp | `whatsapp` | Chat ID or phone |
| Signal | `signal` | Phone number |

### Autonomy Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Monitor only — alerts, no drafts |
| 1 | Draft + Approve — drafts replies, waits for your OK |
| 2 | Auto-reply simple — handles "thanks", scheduling automatically |
| 3 | Full autonomous — replies as you, books meetings |

**Default is Level 1.** Change with:
```bash
linkedin-monitor config autonomyLevel 2
```

## Communication Style

Drafts are generated using your communication style from `USER.md` in your Clawdbot workspace.

If you don't have a `USER.md`, create one with your preferences:

```markdown
# USER.md

## Communication Style
- Keep messages short (3-4 sentences)
- Be friendly but professional
- No corporate jargon
- Always offer value first
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Browser not running"
```bash
clawdbot browser start --profile clawd
# Then log into LinkedIn
```

### "LinkedIn logged out"
Open the clawd browser and log back into LinkedIn manually. The browser is usually on your second desktop.

### "Duplicate notifications"
```bash
linkedin-monitor reset
# This clears state — next check will see all messages as "new"
```

### "Cron not running"
```bash
linkedin-monitor disable
linkedin-monitor enable
# Check: crontab -l
```

### "Watchdog alert: Monitor may be down"
```bash
linkedin-monitor health
# Fix whatever's broken, then:
linkedin-monitor check
```
