## Configuration

### API Credentials

**Where to find your Kit API credentials:**

1. Log in to Kit: https://app.kit.com
2. Click your profile picture → **Settings**
3. Go to **Advanced** → **API**
4. Copy:
   - **API Key** (starts with `kit_...`)
   - **API Secret** (long string)

**Storage location:** `~/.kit-credentials` (encrypted)

---

### Voice Training (Optional)

**How to train your brand voice:**

1. Collect 3-5 past emails you've written
2. Tell agent: `"Train my email voice"`
3. Paste complete emails (subject + body + signature)
4. Agent analyzes tone, structure, vocabulary

**Storage location:** `~/.kit-voice-samples.json`

---

### Business Context

**What the agent needs to know:**

- **Niche/Industry:** What you do
- **Target Audience:** Who you serve
- **Offer:** What you sell
- **Key Links:** Website, booking page, product pages

**Storage location:** `~/.kit-business-context.json`

---

## Usage Examples

### Create Your First Email

```
You: "Create a nurture email"

Agent: [Asks clarifying questions]
        ↓
        [Generates 3 subject line options]
        ↓
        [Writes email body with personalization]
        ↓
        [Shows complete draft for review]
        ↓
You: "Send it now"

Agent: [Creates broadcast in Kit]
       [Shows confirmation with broadcast ID]
```

---

### Check Campaign Performance

```
You: "Show stats for my last email"

Agent: [Fetches broadcast stats]
       ↓
       [Displays open rate, click rate, benchmarks]
       ↓
       [Provides AI insights and recommendations]
```

---

### Manage Subscribers

```
You: "Add a new subscriber"

Agent: [Prompts for email and details]
       ↓
       [Creates subscriber in Kit]
       ↓
       [Confirms with subscriber ID]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No credentials found"

**Problem:** Agent can't find Kit API credentials

**Solution:**
```bash
node scripts/credentials.js exists
```

If returns "no":
```bash
node scripts/credentials.js store --key="kit_xxx" --secret="xxx"
```

Or run setup wizard again: Tell agent `"Set up Kit email marketing"`

---

### "Authentication failed"

**Problem:** Kit API credentials are invalid or expired

**Solution:**
1. Go to Kit: https://app.kit.com/settings/advanced
2. **Regenerate** your API credentials
3. Update in skill:
   ```
   Tell agent: "Update Kit credentials"
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   node scripts/credentials.js store --key="NEW_KEY" --secret="NEW_SECRET"
   ```

---

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Problem:** Too many API requests in short time

**Solution:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Kit API rate limits are conservative (built into skill)
- If urgent, save as draft and schedule for later

---

### "Broadcast failed to send"

**Problem:** Kit rejected the broadcast

**Common causes:**
- Subject line too long (>255 characters)
- Invalid personalization tags
- No subscribers in selected segment/tag

**Solution:**
- Check error message from Kit API
- Fix issue and retry
- Agent will provide specific guidance

---

### "Voice training not working"

**Problem:** Brand voice analysis failed

**Solution:**
- Paste at least 3-5 COMPLETE emails
- Include subject line, full body, and signature
- Use emails YOU wrote (not AI-generated)

**Retry:**
```
Tell agent: "Train my voice"
```

---

## Security & Privacy

### What Gets Stored

**Encrypted (secure):**
- `~/.kit-credentials` - Kit API key and secret

**Plain text (not sensitive):**
- `~/.kit-voice-samples.json` - Your past email examples
- `~/.kit-business-context.json` - Business info you provide
- `~/.kit-custom-fields.json` - Cached custom field names

**Location:** Your OpenClaw workspace (`/data/.openclaw/workspace/`)

---

### What DOESN'T Get Stored

❌ **No subscriber data** - Always fetched from Kit API  
❌ **No email content** - Created on-demand  
❌ **No personal info** - This is a generic skill (no Kevin-specific data)  
❌ **No external services** - Everything runs locally or via Kit API

---

### Encryption Details

**Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM  
**Key derivation:** PBKDF2 with machine-specific salt  
**Key tied to:** Your hostname + homedir (credentials won't work on other machines)

---

### Credential Safety

✅ **DO:**
- Store credentials via provided scripts
- Keep backup of API credentials in password manager
- Regenerate if compromised

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit credentials to git
- Share credentials files
- Display credentials in plain text
