## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/twilio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set Your Credentials
```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="AC35fce9f5069e4a19358da26286380ca9"
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="a7700999dcff89b738f62c78bd1e33c1"
export TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+19152237302"
```

Or create `.env` and load it:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env  # Edit with your credentials
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works
```bash
bash test_twilio_setup.sh
```

If all checks pass ✓, you're ready!

### Step 4: Start the Server
```bash
python webhook_server.py
```

You should see:
```
============================================================
Twilio SMS Webhook Server Starting
============================================================
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 5000
...
============================================================
```

### Step 5: Expose to Internet (Terminal 2)
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

You'll see something like:
```
Forwarding  https://abc123def456.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL (the `https://abc123def456.ngrok.io` part).

### Step 6: Configure Twilio
1. Open: https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming
2. Click your phone number: **(915) 223-7302**
3. Find "Messaging" section
4. Set "A Message Comes In" to **Webhooks**
5. Paste your ngrok URL + `/sms`:
   ```
   https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/sms
   ```
6. Click **Save**

### Step 7: Test It!
Text your Twilio number from your phone:
```
Hello webhook!
```

Check Terminal 1 (server logs):
```
INFO: Received SMS from +19152134309: Hello webhook!
INFO: Successfully forwarded message to gateway
```

### Step 8: Send a Reply (Terminal 3)
```bash
python respond_sms.py --to "+19152134309" --message "Got your message!"
```

**Done!** 🎉 You have a working two-way SMS system!

## 📞 Common Commands

```bash
# Receive SMS (always running)
python webhook_server.py

# Send a reply
python respond_sms.py --to "+19152134309" --message "Hi!"

# View a conversation
python respond_sms.py --to "+19152134309" --view

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Test Script
```bash
bash test_twilio_setup.sh
```

This checks everything. If it passes ✓, skip to Step 3.

### Step 2: Check Common Issues
- **Port 5000 in use?** → `lsof -i :5000` then `kill -9 <PID>`
- **ngrok not running?** → `ngrok http 5000` in another terminal
- **Credentials wrong?** → `echo $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` should show your ID
- **No messages received?** → Check Twilio webhook URL is correct

### Step 3: Read the Full Guide

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **This system includes:**
- Twilio signature validation (prevents spoofing)
- Environment variable credentials (no hardcoded secrets)
- HTTPS only (ngrok/Tailscale handle encryption)
- Error logging without exposing sensitive data

⚠️ **Remember:**
- Never share your Account SID or Auth Token
- Keep `.env` file secret (add to `.gitignore`)
- Monitor Twilio logs for unusual activity

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

### Immediate
1. Get it working with ngrok
2. Send and receive test messages
3. View conversation history

### Next Week
1. Switch to Tailscale Funnel (persistent URL)
2. Set up monitoring/alerts
3. Create message templates

### Next Month
1. Integrate with Clawdbot chat
2. Add auto-reply features
3. Archive old conversations
