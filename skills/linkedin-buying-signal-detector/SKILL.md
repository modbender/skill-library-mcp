## 💡 Why This Skill Dominates

Most lead gen tools find *who* to contact. This skill tells you *when* to contact them — at the exact moment they have **budget, urgency, and intent**. No SaaS equivalent under $2,000/month.

**Buying signals detected:**
- 🚀 Company hiring Sales/Marketing roles → scaling, has budget
- 🔧 Hiring DevOps/Cloud Engineers → infrastructure investment incoming
- 📈 Headcount growth > 20% in 90 days → expansion phase
- 💼 New C-level hire (CMO, CTO, VP Sales) → new budget owner, new priorities
- 📣 Job descriptions mentioning competitor tools → switching signal
- 🏆 Recent funding round mention in job posts → fresh cash to spend
