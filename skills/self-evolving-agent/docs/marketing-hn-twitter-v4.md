## 📰 HackerNews — Show HN Post

**Title:**
```
Show HN: Self-Evolving Agent – AI that reviews its own logs and proposes AGENTS.md improvements
```

**Body:**

```
Every week, this tool reads your AI assistant's chat logs and cron errors,
finds recurring failure patterns, and drafts rule improvements for your
AGENTS.md — then waits for you to approve before touching anything.

I've been running it in production on top of OpenClaw (part of the 145k+
star ecosystem) for a few months. Last week's scan found 405 exec retry
events across 7 days, including one command that retried 119 consecutive
times without me noticing. It also flagged 18 repeated assistant errors
that crossed session boundaries — the kind of thing that hides in log noise.

**Architecture:** 4 bash scripts + 1 Claude API call (Sonnet 4.5)

  Stage 1 (collect-logs.sh)       — parse chat sessions + cron logs
  Stage 2 (semantic-analyze.sh)   — keyword matching + structural heuristics
  Stage 3 (benchmark.sh)          — measure effect of last week's proposals
  Stage 4 (synthesize-proposal.sh)— single Claude call to draft improvements

Stages 1–3 run entirely locally. The API call only happens at Stage 4,
which is why the cost stays under $0.05/week (~3,000 input tokens,
~1,500 output tokens, no caching).

**The part I think is genuinely different:** Stage 3 measures whether
previous proposals actually helped. It tracks pattern frequency before and
after each accepted rule change. 30%+ drop = Effective, ±30% = Neutral,
frequency increase = Regressed (flagged for re-review). This closes the
feedback loop that most self-improvement schemes skip entirely.

**Honest limitations:**
- Heuristic, not semantic. Pattern matching with context window checks
  (±3 lines), role filtering (user vs. assistant), and emotion-signal
  weighting. Not actual language understanding.
- ~15% estimated false positive rate (down from ~40% in v3.0, but still
  a heuristic estimate — we haven't done a rigorous eval).
- Effect measurement is correlation, not causation. Confounders
  (usage pattern changes, other rules) aren't controlled.
- AGENTS.md is OpenClaw-specific. Works with CLAUDE.md or any markdown
  rule file, but you'll need to point it at the right path.

### Tweet 1 — Hook

```
My AI assistant found 405 exec retry events in 7 days.

Including one command that retried 119 times in a row.

I didn't notice. It did.

🧵 What I built to make this happen (and why the feedback loop matters):
```

### Tweet 2 — What It Is

```
Self-Evolving Agent v4.0

Every Sunday, it scans my AI assistant's logs:
• Chat session transcripts
• Cron job errors
• Exec retry chains

Then it drafts improvements to my AI's rule file (AGENTS.md) — based
on what actually went wrong that week.

No auto-apply. I review and approve every change.
```

### Tweet 3 — 4-Stage Pipeline

```
The pipeline is 4 bash scripts + 1 API call:

Stage 1 ── collect-logs.sh
           Parse sessions, cron errors, retry chains

Stage 2 ── semantic-analyze.sh
           Keyword match + context window + role filter

Stage 3 ── benchmark.sh  ← the part most skip
           Did last week's rule change actually help?

Stage 4 ── synthesize-proposal.sh
           ONE Claude API call to draft improvements

Stages 1–3 run locally. $0 until Stage 4.
```

### Tweet 4 — The Killer Feature

```
The part I'm most proud of: Stage 3.

Most self-improvement loops propose changes and move on.
Mine measures whether the last proposal worked:

→ Pattern frequency before the rule change
→ Pattern frequency after
→ 30%+ drop?   ✅ Effective
→ ±30%?        😐 Neutral (more data needed)
→ Frequency up? 🔴 Regressed — reflagged for removal

It's not causal inference. But it's better than flying blind.
```

### Tweet 5 — Cost + Honest Limitations

```
Cost: < $0.05/week
(~3k input tokens + ~1.5k output, Sonnet 4.5, weekly run)

Honest limitations:
• Heuristic, not semantic (~15% false positive est.)
• That 15% is a heuristic estimate — not a rigorous eval
• Effect measurement is correlation, not causation
• Works best with OpenClaw / AGENTS.md but adapts to CLAUDE.md

If you want zero false positives: read your own logs 😅
```

### Tweet 6 — Link + CTA

```
Open source, MIT, runs in OpenClaw (part of the 145k+ ⭐ ecosystem).

If you've ever fixed the same AI mistake twice in a week — this
is the thing I wish I'd built sooner.

## 📝 Notes

- HN post aims for ~400 words — long enough to pre-answer common
  questions, short enough not to feel like marketing copy.
- Limitation paragraph goes in the HN body, not a footnote. HN
  readers reward honesty and will ask if you hide it.
- Twitter thread ordered: Hook → What → How → Why it's different →
  Caveats → CTA. Don't lead with caveats (kills momentum) but don't
  bury them either.
- "119 consecutive retries" is the pull quote. Use it in both.
- Don't use the word "revolutionary", "game-changing", or "magic".
  HN and technical Twitter audiences flag these immediately.
