## 5. Mechanism

### Why This Happened

[Explain the dominant drivers inferred from traces]

### Key Patterns

- [Pattern 1: e.g., "Low-income agents without transit access defaulted to protest"]
- [Pattern 2: e.g., "Partner conversations reinforced existing positions"]
- [Pattern 3: e.g., "Coworker influence dominated in Week 2"]
