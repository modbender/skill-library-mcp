### Manual Publishing

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Validate
bash .validate.sh

# 2. Authenticate
clawhub login

# 3. Submit
clawhub submit .

# 4. Monitor
clawhub status lunchtable-tcg
```

### Automated Publishing via GitHub Actions

On every version tag push:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions automatically:
- Validates skill structure
- Submits to ClawHub
- Publishes to npm (if configured)
- Creates GitHub release

**Setup required:**
1. Add `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
2. Add `NPM_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets (optional)

Generate tokens:
```bash
clawhub token create
npm token create
```

## Verification Checklist

After submission, ClawHub verifies:

- ✓ Valid SKILL.md with proper YAML frontmatter
- ✓ Required binaries (curl) documented
- ✓ OS compatibility listed
- ✓ Environment variables documented
- ✓ Examples are functional
- ✓ License is specified (MIT)
- ✓ No security vulnerabilities

## Post-Submission Tracking

```bash
# Check submission status
clawhub status lunchtable-tcg

# View detailed logs
clawhub logs lunchtable-tcg

# Check review comments
clawhub comments lunchtable-tcg
```

### Review Timeline

1. **Immediate**: Automated validation (file structure, YAML)
2. **5-10 min**: Security scan, dependency check
3. **1-3 days**: Manual review by ClawHub team
4. **Instant**: Publication after approval

## After Approval

Users can install your skill:

```bash
# From ClawHub registry
openclaw skill install lunchtable-tcg

# From npm (if published)
openclaw skill add @lunchtable/openclaw-skill-ltcg

# From GitHub
openclaw skill add https://github.com/lunchtable/ltcg/tree/main/skills/lunchtable/lunchtable-tcg
```

Monitor usage:
```bash
clawhub stats lunchtable-tcg
clawhub ratings lunchtable-tcg
clawhub feedback lunchtable-tcg
```

## Updating Published Skills

Update and republish:

```bash
# 1. Update version in SKILL.md, package.json, .clawhub.json
# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
# 3. Republish

./publish.sh
```

Or create a new tag:
```bash
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
# GitHub Actions handles the rest
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

```bash
# "clawhub: command not found"
npm install -g @clawhub/cli

# "Not authenticated"
clawhub login

# "Skill name already exists"
# Change name in SKILL.md to: yourusername-lunchtable-tcg

# "Validation failed"
bash .validate.sh  # See specific errors
```
