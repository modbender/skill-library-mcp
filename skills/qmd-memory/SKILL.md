## 🚀 QUICK START

```bash
# Install the skill
clawhub install asabove/qmd-memory

# Run setup (installs QMD, configures collections)
openclaw skill run qmd-memory setup

# That's it. Your memory is now supercharged.
```

---

## WHAT YOU GET

### 1. Automatic Collection Setup

Based on your workspace structure, we create optimized collections:

```
✓ workspace     — Core agent files (MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, etc.)
✓ daily-logs    — memory/*.md daily logs
✓ intelligence  — intelligence/*.md (if exists)
✓ projects      — projects/**/*.md (if exists)
✓ documents     — Any additional doc folders you specify
```

### 2. Smart Context Descriptions

We add context to each collection so QMD understands what's where:

```
qmd://workspace    → "Agent identity and configuration files"
qmd://daily-logs   → "Daily work logs and session history"
qmd://intelligence → "Analysis, research, and reference documents"
```

### 3. Pre-configured Cron Jobs

```bash
# Auto-update index (nightly at 3am)
0 3 * * * qmd update && qmd embed

# Keep your memory fresh without thinking about it
```

### 4. OpenClaw Integration

Memory search now uses QMD automatically:
- `memory_search` → routes to QMD hybrid search
- `memory_get` → retrieves from QMD collections
- Results include collection context

### 5. Multi-Agent MCP Server (Optional)

```bash
# Start shared memory server
openclaw skill run qmd-memory serve

# All your agents can now query collective memory
# Forge, Thoth, Axis — shared knowledge base
```

---

## 📊 SEARCH MODES

| Mode | Command | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Keyword** | `qmd search "query"` | Exact matches, fast |
| **Semantic** | `qmd vsearch "query"` | Conceptual similarity |
| **Hybrid** | `qmd query "query"` | Best quality (recommended) |

### Example Queries

```bash
# Find exact mentions
qmd search "Charlene" -n 5

# Find conceptually related content
qmd vsearch "how should we handle customer complaints"

# Best quality — expansion + reranking
qmd query "what decisions did we make about pricing strategy"

# Search specific collection
qmd search "API keys" -c workspace
```
