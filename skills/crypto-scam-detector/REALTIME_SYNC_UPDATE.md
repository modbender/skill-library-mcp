   Check again in a few minutes...
```

**After (v2.1.0):**
```
⏳ Address not in database. Fetching from Etherscan...
   This may take 5-10 seconds...

🔄 Step 1/4: Fetching transaction count...
🔄 Step 2/4: Fetching balance...
🔄 Step 3/4: Analyzing transactions (up to 100)...
🔄 Step 4/4: Calculating risk score...
✅ Analysis complete! (6.2s)

🚨 Risk: 70/100 - HIGH RISK
[Full analysis displayed immediately]
```

### 📊 Benefits

### ⚡ Performance

| Scenario | v2.0.0 | v2.1.0 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Cached address** | <5ms | <5ms (same) |
| **New address** | Wait for worker + re-check | 5-10s (instant sync) |
| **User experience** | Multi-step | Single check |

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**Modified file:** `crypto_check_db.py`

**New function:** `sync_address_realtime()`
- Fetches data from Etherscan immediately
- Shows progress updates to user
- Returns analysis after sync completes

**Updated function:** `check_address()`
- Checks database first (instant)
- If not found → syncs immediately
- Returns full analysis

### 💡 Usage

**No changes to command:**
```bash
python3 crypto_check_db.py 0x...
```

**Behavior:**
1. Checks local database first
2. If found → returns instantly (<5ms)
3. If not found → syncs from Etherscan (5-10s)
4. Shows progress during sync
5. Returns full analysis

### 🎨 Progress Messages

The user sees real-time feedback:

1. **Initial message:**
   ```
   ⏳ Address not in database. Fetching from Etherscan...
      This may take 5-10 seconds...
   ```

2. **Step 1:**
   ```
   🔄 Step 1/4: Fetching transaction count...
   ```

3. **Step 2:**
   ```
   🔄 Step 2/4: Fetching balance...
   ```

4. **Step 3:**
   ```
   🔄 Step 3/4: Analyzing transactions (up to 100)...
   ✅ Synced 0x... - Risk: 85/100 (high)
      ⚠️  Found 3 suspicious transactions
   ```

5. **Step 4:**
   ```
   🔄 Step 4/4: Calculating risk score...
   ✅ Analysis complete! (6.2s)
   ```

### 🔄 Background Worker Still Useful

The background worker (`sync_worker.py`) is still useful for:

- **Bulk syncing** - Process many addresses at once
- **Scheduled updates** - Re-sync old addresses periodically
- **Batch processing** - Handle queued addresses
- **Offline preparation** - Pre-populate database

But now it's **optional** for basic usage!

### 🆚 Comparison

**v2.0.0 Workflow:**
```
1. User checks address
2. Returns "not in database"
3. User waits for background worker
4. User checks again
5. Gets result
```

**v2.1.0 Workflow:**
```
1. User checks address
2. Syncs automatically (5-10s)
3. Gets result immediately
```

### ⚙️ Error Handling

If Etherscan API fails:
```bash
❌ Error: Failed to fetch data from Etherscan. Please try again.

📋 Recommendations:
  ⚠️ Could not analyze address
  🔧 Check API key configuration
  ⏳ Try again in a moment
```

If API key not configured:
```bash
❌ Error: Etherscan API key not configured. Please run: ./setup.sh

📋 Recommendations:
  ⚠️ Could not analyze address
  🔧 Check API key configuration
  ⏳ Try again in a moment
```

### 🔐 Security

- API key still encrypted (AES-256)
- Only used when needed
- Never logged or exposed
- Safe error messages (no key leakage)

### 📈 Benefits Summary

✅ **Better UX** - Single command, instant results  
✅ **Real-time feedback** - User knows what's happening  
✅ **Estimated time** - Sets expectations (5-10s)  
✅ **Progress updates** - Step-by-step visibility  
✅ **No multi-step** - No need to check twice  
✅ **Backward compatible** - Works with old and new addresses  

### 🚀 Upgrade Path

From v2.0.0 to v2.1.0:

```bash
# Update skill
clawhub update crypto-scam-detector

# Or download new version
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/crypto-scam-detector
cp crypto_check_db.py crypto_check_db.py.backup
# Replace with new version

# No database changes needed
# No API key changes needed
# Just works!
```

### 📊 Typical Sync Times

Based on testing:

- **Simple address** (few transactions): 3-5 seconds
- **Average address** (10-50 transactions): 5-8 seconds
- **Active address** (50-100 transactions): 8-12 seconds
- **High-risk address** (with suspicious TX): 10-15 seconds

Time includes:
- Etherscan API calls (4 requests)
- Transaction analysis
- Message decoding
- Risk calculation
- Database storage
