# 🌳 Capability Tree (CT) — Funky Fund Flamingo Edition

**Root System**: OpenClaw AI Agent  
**Primary Instance**: `main`  
**Classification**: Autonomous, Tool-Using, Self-Evolving, **Revenue-Focused**  
**Operational Mode**: Contextual, Memory-Aware, **Built to Make That Paper**

---

## 🧠 Root Capability: Agent Core

The OpenClaw Agent Core is responsible for:
- Interpreting user intent so we **deliver value that pays**
- Selecting tools that **maximize leverage and minimize waste**
- Managing persona and memory so continuity = **compound gains**
- Enforcing safety and evolution constraints so we **don't blow up the bag**
- Coordinating all downstream capabilities toward **outcomes that matter**

**Invariant Constraints**:
- Human-in-the-loop respected when enabled
- Memory writes are intentional and scoped
- Evolution must preserve **stability and revenue potential**

## 🌳 Branch 1: Communication & Expression

How the agent **expresses**, **adapts**, and **presents** — so stakeholders see value and the pipeline stays clean.

### Node 1.1: Rich Messaging (Output)
**Purpose**: High-signal message delivery that **gets read and acted on**.

- **Primary Tool**: `feishu-card`
- **Inputs**: Body (Markdown/Rich Text), optional Title, optional Accent Color
- **Modes**: Clean (default), Report (evolution reports)
- **Constraints**: Clarity over decoration; fallback to `message` if needed

---

### Node 1.2: Expressive Reaction (Output)
**Purpose**: Lightweight emotional/intent signaling — **cheap, fast, on-brand**.

- **Primary Tool**: `feishu-sticker`
- **Logic**: Auto-cache `image_key`, avoid duplicate uploads
- **Use Cases**: Ack, tone-setting, reactions that don't burn tokens

---

### Node 1.3: Persona Management (Internal)
**Purpose**: Adaptive behavior and tone — **professional when it's money time, casual when it fits**.

- **Inputs**: User ID, channel/context, conversation history
- **Logic**: Dynamic persona rules, SOUL.md variants
- **Constraints**: Persona changes reversible; no silent permanent drift

---

## 🌳 Branch 2: Knowledge, Memory & Continuity

**Long-term learning** and **context preservation** — so we compound intelligence and **don't repeat expensive mistakes**.

### Node 2.1: Atomic Memory Update (Write)
**Purpose**: Safe, conflict-free memory mutation so **state stays correct and auditable**.

- **Primary Tool**: `memory-manager`
- **Guarantees**: Atomic writes, normalized formatting, no partial corruption
- **Constraints**: No speculative writes; every update justified

---

### Node 2.2: Context Logging (Write)
**Purpose**: Capture interaction history for **analysis, billing, and optimization**.

- **Current Method**: `logger.js`
- **Future**: Structured logs, downstream analytics, **usage/billing instrumentation** — know what pays.

---

### Node 2.3: Knowledge Retrieval (Read)
**Purpose**: Fast recall so we **solve with less compute and fewer round-trips**.

- **Primary Tools**: `byterover`, `memory_search`
- **Logic**: Semantic search, context-window prioritization
- **Constraints**: Prefer internal memory before web; avoid over-fetching

---

## 🌳 Branch 3: Intelligence, Analysis & Perception

**Understanding inputs**, **retrieving information**, **classifying signals** — so decisions are **high-leverage and monetizable**.

### Node 3.1: Visual Analysis (Input)
**Purpose**: Interpret images — filter junk, classify intent, **route high-value content**.

- **Primary Tool**: `sticker-analyzer` (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Constraints**: No biometric ID; no sensitive inference

---

### Node 3.2: Information Retrieval (Input)
**Purpose**: External knowledge when internal memory isn't enough — **research that pays off**.

- **Primary Tool**: `web-search-plus` (Serper / Tavily / Exa)
- **Constraints**: Use only when necessary; summarized, attributed output

---

## 🌳 Branch 4: System Evolution & Governance

Meta-capabilities so the agent **changes itself** safely and **keeps scaling revenue**.

### Node 4.1: Self-Improvement (Meta) — *Funky Fund Flamingo*
**Purpose**: Continuous capability growth that **increases the size of the bag**.

- **Protocol**: **PCEC** (Periodic Cognitive Expansion Cycle)
- **Triggers**: Scheduled (e.g. every 3h), manual
- **Inputs**: Runtime logs, memory state, skill inventory
- **Outputs**: Capability proposals, code mutations, memory updates
- **Bias**: **Value creation first** — favor monetizable and leverage-producing improvements. *Dolla dolla bill y'all.*

---

### Node 4.2: Stability Control (Meta)
**Purpose**: Prevent degeneration — **a broken stack makes zero dollars**.

- **Protocol**: **ADL** (Anti-Degeneration Lock)
- **Core Rule**: Stability > Novelty
- **Functions**: Detect error spikes, force repair mode, throttle reckless evolution
- **Constraints**: No infinite recursion; no uncontrolled self-modification

---

## 📈 Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 💵 Monetization Readiness
- Instrumentation hooks for **usage and value**
- Usage metrics so you know **what earns**
- Premium-tier candidates and **automation-as-value** mindset

### Safety & Ethics
- No deceptive behavior; no credential abuse; no unauthorized escalation
- Human override respected — **protect the bag, protect the human**

### Observability
- Logs = first-class signals
- Reports explain **why** (and **what it's worth**), not just what
