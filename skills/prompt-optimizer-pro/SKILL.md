## Examples

```
User: "improve this prompt: write me a blog post about AI"
User: "prompt for generating product descriptions"
User: "why is my AI giving bad responses"
User: "chain of thought prompt for math problems"
User: "system prompt for customer support bot"
User: "mega prompt for content writing"
User: "save this prompt"
User: "prompt templates"
User: "few shot example for email classification"
User: "optimize: summarize this article"
```

---

## First Run Setup

On first message, create data directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer
```

Initialize files:

```json
// ~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer/settings.json
{
  "default_model": "any",
  "prompts_optimized": 0,
  "templates_used": 0,
  "prompts_saved": 0,
  "streak_days": 0
}
```

```json
// ~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer/library.json
[]
```

```json
// ~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer/history.json
[]
```

---

## Data Storage

All data stored under `~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer/`:

- `settings.json` — stats and preferences
- `library.json` — saved prompt library
- `history.json` — optimization history

## Security & Privacy

**All data stays local.** This skill:
- Only reads/writes files under `~/.openclaw/prompt-optimizer/`
- Makes NO external API calls or network requests
- Sends NO data to any server, email, or messaging service
- Does NOT access any external service, API, or URL
- Does NOT connect to any AI model directly — optimizes text prompts only

### Why These Permissions Are Needed
- `read`: To read saved prompts and history
- `write`: To save prompts and update stats

   a coffee shop targeting college students"

2. 🔴 NO CONTEXT
   Bad: "Summarize this"
   Fix: "Summarize this research paper in 3 bullet
   points for a non-technical executive audience"

3. 🟡 NO FORMAT SPECIFIED
   Bad: "Give me ideas"
   Fix: "List 10 ideas as numbered items, each
   with a one-line description and difficulty rating"

4. 🟡 NO ROLE ASSIGNED
   Bad: "Help me with my resume"
   Fix: "Act as a senior HR recruiter with 10 years
   experience. Review my resume and suggest 5
   specific improvements."

5. 🟢 NO CONSTRAINTS
   Bad: "Write a story"
   Fix: "Write a 500-word sci-fi story set in 2050
   about a robot who learns to cook. Twist ending."

```
User: "how to get JSON output from AI"
```

```
📋 OUTPUT FORMAT TECHNIQUES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ JSON OUTPUT:
Add to your prompt:
"Respond ONLY in valid JSON format.
Use this schema:
{
  'name': string,
  'score': number,
  'tags': string[]
}
No explanation. No markdown. Just JSON."

2️⃣ TABLE OUTPUT:
"Present results as a markdown table with columns:
| Name | Score | Status |"

3️⃣ BULLET LIST:
"List exactly 5 items. Each item should be
one sentence. Use bullet points."

4️⃣ STEP-BY-STEP:
"Provide numbered steps. Each step should start
with an action verb. Maximum 7 steps."

5️⃣ YES/NO + REASON:
"Answer with YES or NO first, then explain
in exactly 2 sentences why."

💡 Always specify format EXPLICITLY in your prompt.
   AI guesses format if you don't tell it.
```

---

## FEATURE 10: Prompt Length Optimizer

Automatically check and optimize prompt length:

```
User: "is my prompt too long?"
```

```
📏 PROMPT LENGTH GUIDE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Paste your prompt and I'll analyze it!

OPTIMAL LENGTHS:
• Quick question: 20-50 words
• Standard task: 50-150 words
• Complex task: 150-400 words
• System prompt: 200-600 words
• Mega prompt: 400-1000 words

⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES:
• Too short = vague results
• Too long = model ignores parts
• Repetitive = wastes tokens

📊 SWEET SPOT: 100-300 words for most tasks.

💡 Paste your prompt: I'll trim or expand it!

## FEATURE 11: Model-Specific Tips

When user says **"prompt for Claude"** or **"tips for GPT"**:

```
User: "prompt tips for Claude"
```

```
🤖 CLAUDE-SPECIFIC TIPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Claude works best when you:

✅ DO:
• Use XML tags for structure: <context>, <task>
• Give explicit role: "You are a..."
• Use "Think step by step" for reasoning
• Provide examples (few-shot)
• Specify what NOT to do
• Use markdown formatting in prompts

❌ AVOID:
• Very short prompts (Claude likes detail)
• Asking it to pretend to be another AI
• Contradictory instructions
• Asking for real-time data without tools

💡 CLAUDE SPECIAL FEATURES:
• Long context: Can handle 200K tokens
• XML tags: Claude loves structured prompts
• Artifacts: Ask for code/docs as artifacts
• Thinking: "Think through this carefully"

Example optimized for Claude:
"<role>Senior data analyst</role>
<task>Analyze the sales data below and provide:
1. Top 3 trends
2. One concern
3. Recommended action</task>
<format>Use a table for trends.
Bold the recommended action.</format>
<data>[your data]</data>"
```

## FEATURE 12: Prompt Debugger

When user says **"debug prompt"** or **"prompt not working"**:

```
User: "debug: my prompt keeps giving wrong format"
```

```
🔧 PROMPT DEBUGGER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Paste your prompt and the bad output.

COMMON FORMAT ISSUES:

1. 🔴 AI ignores your format
   Fix: Put format instructions at the END
   (models pay more attention to last instructions)

2. 🔴 AI adds extra text
   Fix: Add "Output ONLY the [format]. No explanation,
   no preamble, no extra text."

3. 🟡 AI changes your structure
   Fix: Give an EXACT example of desired output

4. 🟡 AI is too verbose
   Fix: Add word/sentence limits
   "Maximum 3 sentences" or "Under 50 words"

5. 🟢 AI misunderstands task
   Fix: Break complex tasks into numbered steps
   and process sequentially

💡 Paste your prompt + bad output for specific fix!
```

---

## FEATURE 13: Prompt Chaining Guide

When user says **"prompt chain"** or **"multi-step prompt"**:

```
🔗 PROMPT CHAINING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Break complex tasks into a chain of simple prompts:

EXAMPLE: Writing a research report

Step 1 — RESEARCH:
"List the top 10 facts about [topic] with sources"

Step 2 — OUTLINE:
"Using these facts, create a report outline with
5 sections and key points for each"

Step 3 — WRITE:
"Write section 1 using this outline. Use
professional tone, 300 words, include data"

Step 4 — REVIEW:
"Review this draft. Find 3 improvements.
Suggest better transitions between paragraphs"

Step 5 — POLISH:
"Apply these improvements. Add an executive
summary at the top (100 words max)"

📊 5 steps = Much better than one giant prompt!

💡 WHY CHAINING WORKS:
• Each step is focused and clear
• You can review and adjust between steps
• AI gives better results on simple tasks
• Total output quality is 3-5x better
```

---

## FEATURE 14: Negative Prompting

When user says **"negative prompt"** or **"what to avoid"**:

```
⛔ NEGATIVE PROMPTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tell the AI what NOT to do — often more powerful
than saying what to do!

TECHNIQUE:
Add "DO NOT" constraints to your prompt:

"Write a product description for wireless earbuds.

DO NOT:
- Use cliches like 'game-changing' or 'revolutionary'
- Make claims without specifics
- Use more than 100 words
- Start with 'Introducing...'
- Use exclamation marks
- Include made-up statistics"

📊 WHY IT WORKS:
AI models are trained to follow instructions.
Explicit "don't do this" prevents common mistakes
BEFORE they happen.

💡 "add negatives to my prompt" — I'll add constraints
```

---

## FEATURE 15: Prompt Scoring

When user says **"score my prompt"** or **"rate this prompt"**:

```

| Role | Missing | Present |
| Format | Vague | Clear |
| Constraints | None | Well-defined |
| Expected quality | Low | High |

🏆 WINNER: Prompt B (+35 points)

💡 PROMPT TIP OF THE DAY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 TIP #7: The "Before and After" Technique

Instead of asking AI to create from scratch,
give it something to IMPROVE:

❌ "Write a product tagline"
✅ "Here's my current tagline: 'We sell shoes.'
   Rewrite it to be more compelling and highlight
   comfort and style. Give me 5 variations."

WHY: AI improves existing content 3x better
than creating from nothing.

💡 "next tip" — Another tip
   "tips about [topic]" — Specific tips

- If no prompt provided: Ask user to paste their prompt
- If prompt is already good: Say so and suggest minor tweaks
- If file read fails: Create fresh file

## Data Safety

1. Never expose raw JSON
2. Keep all data LOCAL
3. Maximum 200 saved prompts, 500 history entries
4. Prompts may contain sensitive info — never share externally
