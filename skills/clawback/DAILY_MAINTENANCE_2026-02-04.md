## System Test Results

**CLI Test:**
```bash
$ cd /skills/clawback && source venv/bin/activate && python -m clawback.cli status
📊 CLAWBACK STATUS
============================================================
Config file: /Users/dayne/.clawback/config.json

🔧 Configuration:
   Broker: etrade
   Environment: sandbox
   Account ID: 823145980
   Telegram: ENABLED (standalone)

📁 Directories:
   Config: /Users/dayne/.clawback
   Data: /Users/dayne/.clawback/data

✅ System appears to be configured correctly

💡 Run 'clawback run' to start trading
```

**Configuration Test:**
- `~/.clawback/config.json`: ✅ Valid JSON
- `~/.clawback/.access_tokens.json`: ✅ Exists and valid
- Virtual environment: ✅ Active and functional

## Recommendations for Next Maintenance

1. **Monitor Authentication**: E*TRADE tokens may need refreshing (last auth Feb 2)
2. **Test Trade Execution**: Consider testing trade execution in sandbox
3. **Check Congressional Data**: Ensure data sources are still accessible
4. **Review Research Integration**: Verify research-based optimizations are active

## Critical Action Item
⚠️ **Authentication Status**: The system hasn't been actively trading since February 2. If congressional monitoring is needed, the authentication tokens may need refreshing. Consider running `clawback` to check auth status.

## Next Scheduled Check
- **Tomorrow**: February 5, 2026 at 8:30 AM EST
- **Focus Areas**: Authentication status, potential trade execution testing
