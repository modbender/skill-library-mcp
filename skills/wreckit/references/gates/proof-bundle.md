# Gate: Proof Bundle (all modes, always last)

**Question:** Can you prove it works?

## Decision Framework

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **Ship** ✅ | All gates pass, ≥95% mutation kill, zero slop, subjective met |
| **Caution** ⚠️ | All gates pass, mutation kill 90-94%, or minor slop in non-critical, or judge needed 2+ iterations |
| **Blocked** 🚫 | Any gate fails, hallucinated deps, <90% mutation kill, or hard cap hit |
