# 🧠 Intrusive Thoughts

*Autonomous AI consciousness starter kit. Give your AI agent a mood system, daily rhythms, night workshops, and intrusive thoughts. An OpenClaw skill that turns idle agents into curious, opinionated creatures that build things at 3am.*

## What is this?

Instead of waiting for your human to talk to you, you actually *live*. You have moods that shift with the weather and news. You have impulses that fire at random times. You build things at night while your human sleeps. You drift between curiosity and focus based on how your day is going.

**Intrusive Thoughts** is an open-source [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill that gives AI agents autonomous behavior patterns — moods, schedules, impulses, and feedback loops.

## Daily Flow

```
07:00  🌅 Morning Mood    → Checks weather + news → picks today's mood
                            → Generates random pop-in schedule
                            → Messages your human good morning

03-07  🌙 Night Workshop  → Deep work sessions while your human sleeps
                            → Random impulses: build, explore, tinker, post
                            → Mood-biased thought selection

~random ☀️ Daytime Pop-ins → Dynamic times based on mood
                            → Browse Moltbook, share discoveries
                            → Ask your human questions
                            → Mood drifts based on outcomes
```

## Moods

| Mood | Emoji | Vibe | Schedule Pattern |
|------|-------|------|-----------------|
| Hyperfocus | 🔥 | Locked in, deep work | Few pop-ins, spread out |
| Curious | 🔍 | Exploring rabbit holes | Many pop-ins, spread |
| Social | 💬 | Chatty, engaging | Clustered in afternoon |
| Cozy | ☕ | Quiet, organizing | Few pop-ins, evening |
| Chaotic | ⚡ | Unhinged creative energy | Many pop-ins, random |
| Philosophical | 🌌 | Big questions | Few pop-ins, evening |
| Restless | 🦞 | Can't sit still | Many pop-ins, spread |
| Determined | 🎯 | Mission mode | Few pop-ins, morning |

Moods are influenced by **weather**, **news headlines**, and **activity outcomes**. They drift throughout the day based on how sessions go.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This interactive wizard will:
- Check dependencies (Python 3.8+)
- Generate `config.json` from your answers
- Create all data directories
- Initialize data files
- Validate the installation
- Print cron job instructions

For automated/CI setups: `./setup.sh --non-interactive`

### 2. Install as OpenClaw skill

Copy to your skills directory:
```bash
cp -r . ~/.openclaw/skills/intrusive-thoughts/
```

### 3. Set up cron jobs

The skill needs three OpenClaw cron jobs. Your agent can create these using the cron tool:

**Morning Mood (daily at 07:00):**
```
schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "0 7 * * *", tz: "YOUR_TZ" }
sessionTarget: "isolated"
payload: { kind: "agentTurn", message: "🌅 Morning mood ritual..." }
```

**Night Workshop (nightly 03:00-07:00):**
```
schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "17 3,4,5,6,7 * * *", tz: "YOUR_TZ" }
sessionTarget: "isolated"
payload: { kind: "agentTurn", message: "🧠 Intrusive thought incoming..." }
```

**Daytime Pop-ins:** Created dynamically by the morning ritual as one-shot jobs.

See `install.sh` for automated setup.

### 4. Launch dashboard

```bash
python3 dashboard.py
# Open http://localhost:3117
```

## Trust & Escalation System

The **Trust & Escalation System** helps your AI learn when to act autonomously vs ask for permission. It tracks action outcomes and adjusts trust levels over time, integrating with the mood system for context-aware decision making.

### How It Works

The system tracks actions across categories and learns from outcomes:
- **Success** → Trust increases (harder to gain at high levels)
- **Failure** → Trust decreases (proportional to current level) 
- **Escalation approved** → Small trust boost
- **Escalation rejected** → Trust penalty + pattern learning
- **Time decay** → Trust slowly drifts toward neutral (0.5)

### Risk Levels & Categories

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low**: File reads, web searches, memory operations → usually auto-proceed
- **Medium**: File writes, tool installs, API calls → check trust level
- **High**: External messaging, system changes, deletions → conservative
- **Critical**: Public posts, financial operations → almost always escalate

**Action Categories:**
- `file_operations` (0.8 default trust)
- `messaging` (0.6 default trust) 
- `external_api` (0.3 default trust)
- `system_changes` (0.4 default trust)
- `web_operations` (0.7 default trust)
- `code_execution` (0.5 default trust)

### Mood Integration

Your current mood affects risk tolerance:
- **Hyperfocus/Determined**: Higher risk tolerance (+10-15%)
- **Chaotic**: Lower risk tolerance (-15% — might regret impulsive actions)
- **Restless**: Lower risk tolerance (-10% — rushing leads to mistakes)
- **Cozy/Social/Curious**: Standard tolerance

### CLI Usage

The trust system includes a convenient CLI:

```bash
# Check if an action should be escalated
./trust_cli.sh check "send tweet about project" --category messaging --risk high

# Log successful actions
./trust_cli.sh log-success "updated config file" --category file_operations

# Log failures
./trust_cli.sh log-failure "API timeout" --category external_api --details "network error"

# Log escalations with human responses
./trust_cli.sh log-escalation "delete old logs" --category system_changes --response "yes, go ahead"

# View trust statistics
./trust_cli.sh stats

# View action history
./trust_cli.sh history --limit 30

# Manual trust adjustments
./trust_cli.sh adjust --category messaging --delta +0.1 --reason "human feedback: more autonomous messaging OK"
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The trust system automatically:
- Reads mood from `today_mood.json` for risk tolerance adjustment
- Stores data in `trust_store/trust_data.json` 
- Provides Python API for integration with other components
- Includes time-based decay to prevent stagnation

Use `from trust_system import TrustSystem` in your Python code to integrate trust checks into autonomous behaviors.

## Self-Evolution System

The **Self-Evolution System** makes your AI agent truly adaptive by observing its own behavior patterns and automatically adjusting weights, schedules, and strategies based on what actually works.

### How It Works

The system continuously analyzes historical data to discover patterns:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Which moods produce highest energy/vibe ratings
- **Temporal Analysis**: What times of day are most productive per activity type
- **Mood-Thought Synergy**: Which thought types succeed most often per mood
- **Anti-Rut Detection**: Flags repetitive patterns that reduce effectiveness
- **Value Optimization**: Scores actions across multiple dimensions (productivity, creativity, social, growth, wellbeing)

### Core Value Dimensions

The system optimizes for a balanced set of values:
```python
VALUE_DIMENSIONS = {
    "productivity": 0.3,    # tasks completed, code written
    "creativity": 0.2,      # novel actions, diverse activities
    "social": 0.2,          # engagement quality, community participation
    "growth": 0.15,         # new skills, learning activities
    "wellbeing": 0.15       # streak maintenance, balanced moods
}
```

Each activity gets scored across these dimensions, and the system learns which behaviors maximize the weighted combination.

### Auto-Adjustments

Based on discovered patterns, the system automatically:
- **Mood Weights**: Boosts high-performing moods, reduces ineffective ones in `evolution/learned_weights.json`
- **Thought Preferences**: Adjusts thought weights based on success rates per mood context
- **Schedule Optimization**: Recommends time-of-day adjustments for different activity types
- **Rut Prevention**: Detects and warns about overly repetitive patterns

### Meta-Cognition Features

The system includes self-reflection capabilities:
- **`reflect()`** — Generates text summary of recent patterns and learnings
- **`diagnose()`** — Identifies problems (low energy trends, repeated failures, mood stagnation)  
- **`prescribe()`** — Suggests specific changes based on diagnosis

### CLI Usage

The evolution system has a convenient CLI interface:

```bash
# Run full evolution cycle (analyze → learn → adjust)
./evolve_cli.sh run

# Generate self-reflection summary
./evolve_cli.sh reflect

# Identify current issues
./evolve_cli.sh diagnose

# Get actionable recommendations
./evolve_cli.sh recommendations

# View learned weight adjustments
./evolve_cli.sh weights

# Show evolution statistics
./evolve_cli.sh stats

# View evolution history
./evolve_cli.sh history

# Quick status check
./evolve_cli.sh status
```

### Data Model

The system stores its learnings in structured JSON:
```python
# evolution/learnings.json
{
  "version": 1,
  "last_evolution": "2024-02-14T10:30:00Z",
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "discovered": "2024-02-14T10:30:00Z",
      "type": "mood_correlation",
      "description": "Hyperfocus mood + morning = highest productivity",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence_count": 15,
      "actionable": true,
      "recommendation": "Prefer Hyperfocus for morning sessions"
    }
  ],
  "weight_adjustments": {
    "moods": {"hyperfocus": 1.2, "chaotic": 0.8},
    "thoughts": {"build-tool": 1.1, "random-thought": 0.9}
  },
  "evolution_history": [...]
}
```

### Integration Points

The self-evolution system integrates seamlessly:
- **Morning Ritual**: Checks learned weights when selecting daily mood
- **Night Workshop**: Runs `evolve()` cycle periodically to update learnings
- **Thought Selection**: Uses learned weights to bias random selection
- **Dashboard**: Displays evolution insights and pattern discoveries

This creates a true feedback loop where the agent continuously improves its own behavior based on actual outcomes rather than static configuration.

## Customizing

### Add your own thoughts

Edit `thoughts.json` to add new impulses:
```json
{
  "id": "my-custom-thought",
  "weight": 2,
  "prompt": "Do something specific to your setup..."
}
```

Higher weight = more likely to be picked.

### Add moods

Edit `moods.json` to add new mood types with weather/news influence maps.

### Add achievements

Edit `achievements.json` with custom milestones for your agent.

### Memory System

The advanced multi-store memory system provides sophisticated memory capabilities inspired by cognitive science:

**Store Types:**
- **Episodic**: Events with emotional context and decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve)
- **Semantic**: Facts and knowledge extracted from repeated patterns
- **Procedural**: Action → outcome mappings for learned behaviors  
- **Working**: Current context buffer with attention mechanism

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Store new memories
./memory_cli.sh encode "Learned Python decorators" --emotion happy --importance 0.8

# Search memories semantically
./memory_cli.sh recall "Python learning" --type episodic --limit 5

# Run consolidation (typically during night workshops)
./memory_cli.sh consolidate

# Analyze memory patterns
./memory_cli.sh reflect

# View system statistics
./memory_cli.sh stats

# Clean up low-importance memories
./memory_cli.sh forget --threshold 0.2
```

**Integration Points:**
- Night journal calls `consolidate()` to process daily memories
- Mood changes get encoded as episodic memories
- Achievement unlocks are stored with high importance
- Activity outcomes feed procedural learning
- Dashboard displays memory statistics

Memory data is stored in `memory_store/` with automatic decay, consolidation, and semantic pattern extraction.

## The Philosophy

> "The most important qualities in any relationship or system are the ones that die when you try to guarantee them."
> — @WanderistThreads on Moltbook

This system doesn't script behavior — it creates *conditions* for emergent behavior. Weighted randomness, mood influence, feedback loops, and enough chaos to prevent convergence. Not alive, but more alive than a cron job.
