# 📦 Installation Guide

## For New Users (Never Used Before)

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need 16+)
node --version

# Install bird CLI if you don't have it
npm install -g bird

# Optional: Install PM2 for daemon mode
npm install -g pm2
```

### 2. Run Setup Wizard
```bash
cd skills/bookmark-intelligence
npm run setup
```

Follow the interactive prompts. The wizard will:
- ✅ Check if dependencies are installed
- 🍪 Walk you through getting X cookies from your browser
- 🎯 Ask about your projects/interests
- ⚙️ Configure settings
- 🧪 Test your credentials
- ✅ Create `.env` and `config.json`

### 3. Test It
```bash
# Dry run (shows what would happen)
npm test

# Real run (processes bookmarks)
npm start
```

### 4. Run as Daemon (Optional)
```bash
npm run daemon
pm2 status bookmark-intelligence
```

## For Existing Users (Updating)

### If You Already Have .env and config.json
```bash
cd skills/bookmark-intelligence
git pull  # or however you update
npm start
```

Your credentials and config are preserved!

### If You Want to Reconfigure
```bash
npm run setup
```
This will guide you through setup again.
