# complianceclaw

**The regulation changed 6 months ago. Your client just found out from an enforcement notice.**

Federal and state agencies publish 4,000+ rule changes per year. No attorney can read the Federal Register daily. No in-house team can monitor every state agency that touches their business. complianceclaw watches regulatory feeds, maps changes to your clients' industries and obligations, generates compliance checklists, and produces the audit-ready documentation that makes the difference between "we're in compliance" and "we have proof we're in compliance."

**Who it's for:** Regulatory attorneys, in-house compliance teams, healthcare lawyers tracking HIPAA/CMS changes, financial services counsel monitoring SEC/FINRA, and any firm that advises clients in regulated industries.

**What it replaces:** The $200K/year compliance vendor, the associate reading the Federal Register, and the "we didn't know the rule changed" defense that never works.
