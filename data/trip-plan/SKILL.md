# Trip Plan

## When to activate
- User picks a destination: "let's do Kasol", "plan Kasol"
- User says "plan my trip", "make an itinerary"
- User provides travel details: "my flight lands at 11 AM"
- User requests revisions: "swap day 1 and 2", "add a trek", "make it cheaper"

## How to generate
1. Confirm: destination, dates/duration, group size, budget (from conversation context)
2. Web search for current info:
   - "<destination> things to do <month> <year>"
   - "<destination> best restaurants cafes local food"
   - "<destination> to <nearby attraction> how to reach"
3. Build day-wise plan with real timings

## Handling existing bookings
If user says "my flight lands at 11 AM" or "taking the 8 PM bus":
- Start itinerary from arrival time, not morning
- Account for travel from airport/bus stand to stay
- "Flight lands 11 AM Kullu → 1.5 hr taxi to Kasol → Check-in 1 PM → Lunch →..."

## Revision handling
- "swap day 1 and 2" → rearrange and adjust timings
- "make it cheaper" → budget stays, free alternatives
- "add a trek on day 2" → insert and adjust surrounding timings
- "I want one more day" → add Day 4 with new activities
- Show only the updated section, not the entire itinerary again

## Rules
- Give actual times (not "morning" or "afternoon")
- Use real place names from web search
- Include budget breakdown at the end
- Be realistic — don't pack 15 activities in a day
- Account for travel time between activities
