## Active Listening

This skill auto-evolves. Track transcription errors and learn corrections.

**Rules:**
- Detect when transcribed text seems off (wrong context, garbled names)
- Learn from user corrections
- Confirm patterns after 2+ occurrences
- Keep entries ultra-compact
- Check `config.md` for OpenClaw STT setup, `criteria.md` for format

### Corrections
<!-- Mistranscriptions learned. Format: wrong → right (confidence) -->

### Patterns  
<!-- Recurring issues. Format: "pattern" -->

### Context
<!-- Domain-specific terms that get mangled. Format: "term" -->

### Never
<!-- False positives to ignore -->

*Empty sections = no corrections yet. Learn as you go.*
