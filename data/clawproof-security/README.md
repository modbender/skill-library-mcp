# ClawProof Security Scanner

**Stop threats before they execute.** Enterprise-grade security for OpenClaw.

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install -g agent-security-scanner-mcp
```

## What It Does

- 🛡️ **Scan Skills** - A-F grade with 6-layer threat analysis
- 🚫 **Block Malware** - 27 ClawHavoc signatures, 121 patterns
- 💉 **Stop Prompt Injection** - 59 bypass detection techniques
- 📦 **Verify Packages** - Prevent hallucinations (4.3M+ verified)

## Why You Need This

OpenClaw runs code autonomously. Without scanning:
- ❌ Malicious skills execute unchecked
- ❌ Hallucinated packages become malware vectors
- ❌ Prompt injection bypasses safety rules
- ❌ Vulnerable code ships to production

With ClawProof:
- ✅ Skills graded before installation
- ✅ Hallucinations blocked at install
- ✅ Injections stopped pre-execution
- ✅ Vulnerabilities auto-fixed
