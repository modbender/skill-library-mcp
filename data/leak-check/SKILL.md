# Leak Check

Scan OpenClaw session JSONL files for leaked credentials. Reports which real AI provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) received the data, skipping internal delivery echoes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check for leaked credentials (default: discord format)
node scripts/leak-check.js

# JSON output
node scripts/leak-check.js --format json
```

## Configuration

Credentials to check are defined in `leak-check.json`. The script searches for this file in order:

1. **Skill directory** (`./leak-check.json`) — for backward compatibility
2. **`~/.openclaw/credentials/leak-check.json`** — recommended persistent location (survives skill updates via clawhub)

Since clawhub clears the skill directory on updates, place your config in `~/.openclaw/credentials/` to avoid losing it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/credentials
cp leak-check.json ~/.openclaw/credentials/leak-check.json
```

You can also specify an explicit path with `--config`.

```json
[
  { "name": "Discord", "search": "abc*xyz" },
  { "name": "Postmark", "search": "k7Qm9x" }
]
```

**Important:** Do not store full credentials in this file. Use only a partial fragment — enough to uniquely identify the credential via a contains, begins-with, or ends-with match.

**Wildcard patterns:**
- `abc*` — starts with "abc"
- `*xyz` — ends with "xyz"
- `abc*xyz` — starts with "abc" AND ends with "xyz"
- `abc` (no asterisk) — contains "abc"
- `""` (empty) — skip this credential

## Options

- `--format <type>` — Output format: `discord` (default) or `json`
- `--config <path>` — Path to credential config file (default: `./leak-check.json`, then `~/.openclaw/credentials/leak-check.json`)
- `--help`, `-h` — Show help message

## Output

### Discord (Default)

```
🔐 **Credential Leak Check**

⚠️ **2 leaked credentials found**

**Discord Token**
• Session: `abc12345` | 2026-02-14 18:30 UTC | Provider: anthropic

**Postmark**
• Session: `def67890` | 2026-02-10 09:15 UTC | Provider: anthropic
```

Or if clean:

```
🔐 **Credential Leak Check**
✅ No leaked credentials found (checked 370 files, 7 credentials)
```

### Config Echoes

If the `leak-check.json` config file is read or discussed during an OpenClaw session, the credential patterns will appear in that session's JSONL log. The scanner detects this and reports these matches separately as **config echoes** rather than real leaks:

```
📋 **3 possible config echoes** (session contains leak-check config)

• **Discord**: 1 session
...

✅ No credential leaks beyond config echoes
```

Config echoes will continue to appear on every run until the session file is removed. To clear them, delete the session file from `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`:

```bash
rm ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/<session-uuid>.jsonl
```

**Tip:** Avoid reading or referencing `leak-check.json` during an OpenClaw session. If it happens, note the session ID from the report and delete it.

### JSON

```json
{
  "leaks": [
    {
      "credential": "Discord Token",
      "session": "abc12345",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-14T18:30:00.000Z",
      "provider": "anthropic"
    }
  ],
  "configEchoes": [
    {
      "credential": "Gateway",
      "session": "b175e53c",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-19T18:00:30.067Z",
      "provider": "minimax-portal",
      "configEcho": true
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "filesScanned": 370,
    "credentialsChecked": 7,
    "leaksFound": 2,
    "configEchoesFound": 1
  }
}
```

## Security

This skill is designed to be **local-only and read-only**. The following properties can be verified by inspecting `scripts/leak-check.js`:

- **No network access** — no use of `http`, `https`, `net`, `dgram`, `fetch`, `WebSocket`, or any network API
- **No child processes** — no use of `child_process`, `exec`, `spawn`, or `execSync`
- **No external dependencies** — zero `npm` packages; only Node.js built-ins (`fs`, `path`, `os`)
- **No dynamic code execution** — no `eval()`, `Function()`, or dynamic `require()`/`import()`
- **No file writes** — only `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.existsSync`, and `fs.readdirSync` are used; no files are created, modified, or deleted
- **No environment variable access** — does not read `process.env`
- **Output is stdout only** — all results go to `console.log`; nothing is sent elsewhere

### Verify It Yourself

Confirm no unexpected APIs are used anywhere in the script:

```bash
grep -E 'require\(|import |http|fetch|net\.|dgram|child_process|exec|spawn|eval\(|Function\(|\.write|\.unlink|\.rename|process\.env' scripts/leak-check.js
```

Expected output — only the three built-in `require()` calls at the top of the file:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const os = require('os');
```
