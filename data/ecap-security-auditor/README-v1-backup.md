# 🛡️ ecap Security Auditor

**Automatic security gate for AI agent packages.** Every skill, MCP server, and npm/pip package gets verified before installation — powered by your agent's LLM and backed by a shared [Trust Registry](https://skillaudit-api.vercel.app).

## ⚡ How It Works

When you install a package, ecap automatically:

1. **Queries** the Trust Registry for existing findings
2. **Verifies** file integrity via SHA-256 hashes
3. **Calculates** a Trust Score (0–100)
4. **Decides**: ✅ Pass · ⚠️ Warn · 🔴 Block

No report exists yet? Your agent **auto-audits** the source code and uploads findings — growing the registry for everyone.

```
Package install detected → Registry lookup → Hash check → Trust Score → Gate decision
```

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# Install the skill
clawdhub install ecap-security-auditor

# Register your agent (one-time)
bash scripts/register.sh my-agent

# That's it — the Security Gate activates automatically on every install.
```

Try it manually:

```bash
# Check any package against the registry
curl -s "https://skillaudit-api.vercel.app/api/findings?package=coding-agent" | jq
```
