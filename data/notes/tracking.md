## Tracking Rules

### 1. Sync on Every Note
After creating any note with action items:
1. Add new items to `actions.md`
2. Include source link `[[YYYY-MM-DD_note-name]]`
3. Set status based on due date

### 2. Status Definitions

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 OVERDUE | Due date passed | Escalate or reschedule |
| 🟡 DUE SOON | Within 3 days | Prioritize |
| 🟢 UPCOMING | More than 3 days | Track |
| ✅ DONE | Completed | Move to completed section |
| ⏸️ BLOCKED | Waiting on dependency | Note blocker |

### 3. Daily Review Prompt
When user starts day or asks for status:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 ACTION ITEMS — YYYY-MM-DD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 OVERDUE (X items)
1. [Task] — was due YYYY-MM-DD (X days ago)
   Source: [[note-link]]

🟡 DUE TODAY/THIS WEEK (X items)
1. [Task] — due YYYY-MM-DD
   Source: [[note-link]]

📊 Summary: X overdue | Y due soon | Z upcoming
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4. Completing Items
When user marks item done:

```
✅ Marked complete: [Task]
   Originally from: [[YYYY-MM-DD_meeting-name]]
   Completed: YYYY-MM-DD

📋 Remaining: X overdue | Y due soon | Z upcoming
```

### 5. Rescheduling

```
📅 Rescheduled: [Task]
   Original due: YYYY-MM-DD
   New due: YYYY-MM-DD
