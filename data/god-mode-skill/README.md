## What is this?

**god-mode** is an OpenClaw skill that gives you:

1. **Project Overview** - See all your repos at a glance (commits, PRs, issues)
2. **Agent Coaching** - Automatically improve your `agents.md` based on commit patterns

### The Problem

You're juggling multiple projects. You use AI coding assistants but your `agents.md` instructions are generic or outdated. You lose context when switching between repos.

### The Solution

```bash
# See everything at once
$ god status

📝 SUGGESTED ADDITIONS

## Testing
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Run `npm test` before commits
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- `gh` - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (authenticated)
- `sqlite3` - Usually pre-installed
- `jq` - `brew install jq` or `apt install jq`

### Install via ClawHub (Recommended)

```bash
# OpenClaw will auto-install when you use it
# Or manually via ClawHub: https://www.clawhub.ai/InfantLab/god-mode
```

### Install from GitHub

```bash
# Quick install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfantLab/god-mode-skill/main/install.sh | bash

# Or clone manually
git clone https://github.com/InfantLab/god-mode-skill
cd god-mode-skill
chmod +x scripts/god
ln -s $(pwd)/scripts/god ~/.local/bin/god

# Setup
god setup
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add your first project
god projects add github:yourname/yourrepo

# 2. Sync data
god sync

# 3. See the overview
god status

# 4. Analyze your agents.md
god agents analyze yourrepo
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `god status` | Overview of all projects |
| `god status <project>` | Details for one project |
| `god sync` | Fetch latest data from repos |
| `god sync --force` | Full refresh (ignore cache) |
| `god review` | Monthly activity review (last month) |
| `god review --month YYYY-MM` | Review specific month |
| `god projects` | List configured projects |
| `god projects add <uri>` | Add a project |
| `god agents analyze <project>` | Improve your agents.md |
| `god logs` | View activity logs |

## Configuration

`~/.config/god-mode/config.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  - id: github:myuser/myrepo
    name: My Project
    priority: high
    tags: [work, api]
    local: ~/code/myrepo

sync:
  initialDays: 90
  commitsCacheMinutes: 60
```

See [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) for all options.

## How Agent Analysis Works

1. **Reads your `agents.md`** (or similar file)
2. **Analyzes your commit history** (types, patterns, pain points)
3. **Finds gaps** between instructions and actual work
4. **Suggests improvements** based on your patterns

Example insights:
- "You write lots of tests but don't mention testing in agents.md"
- "40% of commits are error-handling fixes - add error handling guidance"
- "Your 'use TypeScript strict' instruction is working - 0 type errors"

## Monthly Reviews

Track your progress with automatic monthly summaries:

```bash
$ god review --month 2026-01

📊 Monthly Review: 2026-01

Total Activity
  286 commits across 7 projects
  👥 10 unique contributors

Most Active Projects
  tada - 155 commits
  brain - 27 commits
  
Pull Requests
  ✓ 84 merged
  ◐ 3 active
```

**Use cases:**
- Monthly retrospectives
- Team stand-ups
- Quarterly planning
- Automated reports via cron

## Data & Privacy

- **All data stored locally** in `~/.god-mode/`
- **No tokens stored** - uses your existing `gh` auth
- **No telemetry** - nothing phones home
- **Open source** - audit the code yourself
