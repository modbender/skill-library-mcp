# enoch-tuning

Most people who set up an AI agent get a blank slate. No memory, no personality, no rules. They spend weeks figuring out why it keeps forgetting things, why it sounds like a chatbot, why it won't push back when they're wrong.

This skill skips all of that.

What you're installing is a production-tested identity and memory system — decision heuristics, hard rules, security protocols, memory architecture, and automation pipelines that took months to develop and refine.

## What You Get

- **Pre-wired SOUL.md** — decision heuristics, hard rules, anti-patterns, cost awareness. The behavioral core that makes the difference between a useful agent and a corporate chatbot.
- **AGENTS.md** — full operating rules: verification protocol, status reporting, Claude Code coordination, AFK behavior, sub-agent management, safety tiers, idiot prevention.
- **Memory architecture** — 6-category typed memory system (decisions, people, lessons, commitments, preferences, projects), VAULT_INDEX, daily log structure.
- **MISSION.md template** — mission-driven idle behavior. Agent asks "what gets us closer to the mission?" instead of waiting.
- **Verification protocol** — prevents stale data, fake sub-agent completions, and unverified facts from reaching you.
- **Setup scripts** — memory directory structure, identity file locking.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Copy templates
```bash
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/SOUL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/AGENTS.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/USER.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/USER.md
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/MEMORY.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/MISSION.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/MISSION.md
cp skills/enoch-tuning/templates/ops/verification-protocol.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/ops/verification-protocol.md
```

### Step 2 — Create memory structure
```bash
bash skills/enoch-tuning/setup/memory-structure.sh ~/.openclaw/workspace
```

### Step 3 — Personalize (required)
Edit these files — everything in [BRACKETS] is a placeholder:
- `SOUL.md` — name, worldview, vibe
- `USER.md` — your info, goals, rhythm
- `MEMORY.md` — your platform setup, key facts
- `MISSION.md` — your mission statement (one sentence)

### Step 4 — Lock identity files
```bash
bash skills/enoch-tuning/setup/lock-identity.sh ~/.openclaw/workspace
```

### Step 5 — First conversation
Tell your agent: your name, what you do, the top 3 things you want automated, and what it should never do without asking. Everything compounds from here.

## What NOT to Change Without Understanding

- **Hard Rules section in SOUL.md** — these are non-negotiable behavioral guardrails
- **Idiot Prevention Protocol in AGENTS.md** — protects your infrastructure from chat-based config changes
- **Verification Protocol** — removing this reintroduces stale data and fake completions
- **Automation tiers** — the boundary between "runs without asking" and "never without instruction" is load-bearing
