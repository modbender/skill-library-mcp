## Skill Overview

**Name:** Tide Watch  
**Slug:** `tide-watch`  
**Purpose:** Session capacity monitoring and management for OpenClaw  
**Description:** Proactive session capacity monitoring to prevent context window lockups

**Architecture:** **Hybrid Skill**
- **Part 1:** AGENTS.md directives (runtime instructions for automatic monitoring)
- **Part 2:** Optional Node.js CLI tool (for manual capacity checks and management)
- **Code files:** Yes - bin/tide-watch (CLI), lib/*.js (library code), tests/*.js
- **Install:** Git clone + optional `npm link` for CLI access

**Core functionality:**
- Monitor OpenClaw session token usage (via directives + CLI)
- Warn at configurable thresholds (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%)
- Archive old sessions (CLI tool)
- Manage session resumption prompts (CLI tool)
- Provide CLI tools for manual capacity checks

---

## Security Evaluation (5 Dimensions)

### 1. Purpose–Capability Alignment ✅ **OK**

**Assessment:** All capabilities directly support session capacity monitoring.

**What the skill claims to do:**
- Monitor session capacity
- Provide warnings at thresholds
- Archive old sessions
- Manage resumption prompts
- CLI tools for capacity checks

**What the skill actually requires:**
- Node.js and npm (for CLI tool)
- Read access to OpenClaw session files (`~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`)
- Write access for resumption prompts and archives
- No external API keys or credentials

**Alignment check:**
- ✅ All file operations are within OpenClaw session directory
- ✅ No unexpected system access
- ✅ No unrelated credentials required
- ✅ No external service integrations
- ✅ Binary dependencies (jest) are dev-only

**Verdict:** Coherent. All capabilities are necessary and proportionate for session management.

---

### 2. Instruction Scope ✅ **OK**

**Assessment:** Instructions stay strictly within session monitoring boundaries.

**SKILL.md directives:**
1. Check `session_status` tool for capacity
2. Read session JSONL files from known directory
3. Parse token usage from session data
4. Write resumption prompts to designated directory
5. Move session files to archive directory

**Scope check:**
- ✅ Only reads from `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`
- ✅ Only writes to `resume-prompts/` and `archive/` subdirectories
- ✅ No shell history access
- ✅ No environment variable exfiltration
- ✅ No external data transmission
- ✅ No credential harvesting

**What instructions do NOT do:**
- ❌ Read user files outside session directory
- ❌ Access environment variables (except for reading session dir path)
- ❌ Make network requests
- ❌ Execute arbitrary commands
- ❌ Modify system configuration

**Verdict:** Properly scoped. Instructions are specific and constrained to session management.

---

### 3. Install Mechanism Risk ✅ **OK** (Low Risk)

**Assessment:** Hybrid skill with AGENTS.md directives + optional CLI tool (Node.js package).

**Install specifications:**
- **Type:** npm package (Node.js CLI tool)
- **Install method:** `npm link` (creates global symlink) or manual git clone
- **Code files:** Yes - CLI tool (bin/tide-watch) + library code (lib/*.js)
- **Extract/download:** No (git clone from GitHub)
- **Third-party URLs:** No

**Risk factors:**
- ✅ No download from arbitrary URLs
- ✅ No archive extraction
- ✅ No binary downloads
- ✅ Source code is fully inspectable
- ✅ Dependencies are minimal (jest for testing only)
- ✅ No install hooks or post-install scripts

**Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.7.0"
  }
}
```

**Risk level:** **LOW** (Hybrid: directives + Node.js CLI tool)

**Verdict:** Install mechanism is transparent. Code is fully inspectable. Users should review lib/*.js and package.json before running `npm link`, as with any Node.js CLI tool.

---

### 4. Environment and Credential Proportionality ✅ **OK**

**Assessment:** No credentials required. Skill operates entirely on local OpenClaw session files.

**Required environment variables:** **NONE**  
**Primary credential:** **NONE**  
**Config path requirements:** **NONE**

**What the skill accesses:**
- OpenClaw session directory (read-only for monitoring)
- Resumption prompts directory (read/write)
- Archive directory (write-only)

**Credential check:**
- ✅ No API keys required
- ✅ No tokens required
- ✅ No passwords required
- ✅ No config file access beyond session directory
- ✅ No channel tokens or gateway auth
- ✅ No tool policy access

**Verdict:** Zero credential requirements. Skill operates on public session data only.

---

### 5. Persistence and Privilege ✅ **OK**

**Assessment:** No privileged access requested.

**Flags:**
- `always: false` (default - not force-included)
- `user-invocable: true` (default - user can trigger manually)
- `disable-model-invocation: false` (default - model can invoke)
- `os: null` (no OS restrictions)

**Privilege check:**
- ✅ Not permanently present (must be invoked)
- ✅ No forced inclusion in all runs
- ✅ Model invocation appropriate for monitoring task
- ✅ No elevated system access

**Runtime behavior:**
- Skill provides directives for heartbeat monitoring (optional)
- User controls activation via AGENTS.md and HEARTBEAT.md
- CLI tool runs on-demand only

**Verdict:** Normal privilege level. No special access requested.

## Static Scan Findings

**Regex-based pattern scan:** No injection patterns detected

**Code quality scan:**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ No suspicious patterns (ignore-instructions, base64 blocks, etc.)
- ✅ No unicode control characters
- ✅ Clean code structure
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (113 tests passing)

**File analysis:**
- Total files: 28
- Code files: 5 (bin/tide-watch, lib/*.js, tests/*.js)
- Documentation: 10+ markdown files
- Test fixtures: 8 files
- No suspicious file types
- No hidden files with concerning names

**Dependencies:**
- Production: 0
- Development: 1 (jest, well-known testing framework)
- No unexpected packages
- No deprecated packages

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Concerns ⚠️ (None Critical)

1. **Archive function moves files** - Could theoretically lose session data
   - **Mitigation:** Dry-run mode available, files moved not deleted, archive directory organized by date
   - **Severity:** Low (user-controlled, reversible)

2. **Resumption prompts contain session context** - Could include sensitive project info
   - **Mitigation:** User creates prompts, stored locally, not transmitted
   - **Severity:** Low (user-controlled content, local storage only)

3. **CLI tool has broad read access to sessions** - Can read all session files
   - **Mitigation:** Read-only access, no modification, session data is local
   - **Severity:** Low (legitimate functionality, no exfiltration)

### Non-Issues ✅

1. **File I/O operations** - Expected for session management
2. **Shell execution (npm link)** - Standard Node.js install pattern
3. **JSON parsing** - Required for reading session JSONL files
4. **No network calls** - Actually a security positive (no data exfiltration)

## VirusTotal Scan

**File hash (package):** N/A (not yet packaged for ClawHub)  
**VirusTotal scan:** Will be performed automatically by ClawHub on publication  
**Pre-scan assessment:** No indicators of malicious behavior

**Expected VirusTotal result:** Clean (0 detections)  
**Reasoning:**
- No executable binaries
- No network activity
- No obfuscated code
- Standard Node.js CLI tool pattern
- All code is human-readable

---

## Clarification: Hybrid Skill Architecture

**Important:** Tide Watch is a **hybrid skill** combining two components:

1. **AGENTS.md Directives** (runtime instructions)
   - Automatic capacity monitoring via heartbeat
   - Warning thresholds (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%)
   - Session resumption prompt auto-loading
   - No code execution required for basic monitoring

2. **Node.js CLI Tool** (optional, requires installation)
   - Manual capacity checks (`tide-watch status`)
   - Cross-session dashboard (`tide-watch dashboard`)
   - Archive management (`tide-watch archive`)
   - Resumption prompt management (`tide-watch resume-prompt`)
   - Requires: `git clone` + optional `npm link`

**Code Files Present:**
- `bin/tide-watch` - CLI entry point
- `lib/capacity.js` - Session parsing and capacity calculations
- `lib/resumption.js` - Resumption prompt management
- `tests/*.js` - Test suite (113 tests)
- `package.json` - npm package manifest

**Network Activity:** None (all operations are local filesystem only)

**Installation:**
- Basic monitoring: Copy AGENTS.md.template directives (no code execution)
- CLI tools: `git clone` + `npm link` (requires Node.js runtime)

This is not a pure "instruction-only" skill. It includes executable code for the CLI tool.
