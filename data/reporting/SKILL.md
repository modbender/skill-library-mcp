  Standardized templates for periodic reports, system audits, revenue tracking, and progress logs.
  All output goes to workspace/artifacts/ directory.

  Use when: generating periodic reports, system audits, performance reviews, revenue tracking,
  weekly retrospectives, daily progress logs, full workspace audits.

  Don't use when: ad-hoc status updates in chat, quick summaries in Discord,
  one-off answers to "how's it going?", real-time dashboards.

  Negative examples:
  - "Give me a quick update" → No. Just answer in chat.
  - "What's the weather?" → No. This is for structured reports.
  - "Post a status to Discord" → No. Just send a message.

  Edge cases:
  - Mid-week report requested → Use weekly template but note partial week.
  - Audit requested for single subsystem → Use full audit template, mark other sections N/A.
  - Revenue snapshot with $0 revenue → Still generate it. Zeros are data.
version: "1.0"
