# X Alpha Scout

Turn your AI agent into an alpha-hunting machine. This skill enables agents to scan X/Twitter for crypto calls, NFT mints, and deliver daily intelligence reports.

## What It Does

- **Comprehensive Daily Alpha Reports** — Auto-generated at 00:00 UTC with market updates, news, CT sentiment, NFT ecosystem coverage (ETH/BTC/SOL), alpha from reputable figures, and warnings
- **On-Demand Analysis** — Ask about any token/NFT and get CT sentiment breakdown

## Perfect For

- Agents that need daily market intelligence
- Traders who want CT sentiment on specific plays
- Anyone wanting structured alpha without the noise

## Installation

1. **Install bird** — X/Twitter CLI tool (by founder of OpenClaw)
   ```bash
   # Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
   brew install steipete/tap/bird
   
   # Or download from releases (if brew doesn't work)
   # https://github.com/steipete/bird/releases
   ```
   
2. **Get X credentials:**
   - Auth token (`X_AUTH_TOKEN`)
   - CT0 cookie (`X_CT0`)
   
3. **Verify access:**
   ```bash
   bird whoami --auth-token "$X_AUTH_TOKEN" --ct0 "$X_CT0"
   ```

## Usage

**Daily Report:**
> "Run my daily alpha"

**On-Demand Analysis:**
> "What do you think of $PEPEAI?"
> "Analyze Pudgy Penguins"

## How It Works

**Stack:**
- `bird` — X/Twitter CLI by founder of OpenClaw (install separately, no API costs)
- `x-alpha-scout` skill — The playbook for what to scan and how to format
- Your agent's reasoning — Parses and structures the alpha

Bird is NOT pre-installed with OpenClaw. Install it via brew or download from releases. Your agent brings its own X credentials, you bring the intelligence.

No Twitter API costs. No rate limits. Just raw alpha.
