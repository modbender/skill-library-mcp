**Tweet 1/15 - Hook**

We spent 3 days solving a problem that keeps happening with AI agents:

They build features perfectly... then forget to connect them to production.

Here's how we built mechanical enforcement to stop it — and discovered something meta. 🧵

**Tweet 2/15 - The Problem**

Feb 2, 2026. Our agent built:
• News-verified trading signals
• Dynamic position management  
• Improved hourly reports

User: "Why are my reports still incomplete?"

The agent forgot to update the CRON job. 😤

Code was perfect. Integration was missing.

**Tweet 3/15 - Initial Response**

First instinct: "Just remember to check next time!"

But we've learned: Rules in markdown = wishful thinking.

Agents don't "remember." They execute instructions. If it's not mechanically enforced, it WILL be forgotten.

Time for a different approach.

**Tweet 4/15 - The Research**

We discovered enforcement has reliability layers:

🟢 Code hooks (100%) - Pre-commit blocks bad commits
🟡 Architecture (95%) - Import registries enforce reuse
🟠 Self-verification (80%) - Agent checks own work
🔴 Prompt rules (60-70%) - AGENTS.md guidelines
⚫ Markdown (40-50%) - Degrades with context

Rule: Move UP the stack.

**Tweet 5/15 - Failure Mode #1: Reimplementation**

Agent writes "quick version" instead of importing validated code.

❌ Markdown rule: "Don't reimplement"
✅ Code hook: Blocks commits containing "quick version"

Result: 100% enforcement. Can't commit without review.

---

**Tweet 6/15 - Failure Mode #2: Secrets**

Agent hardcodes API keys instead of using env vars.

❌ Markdown rule: "Use environment variables"
✅ Code hook: Scans for patterns, blocks on detection

One dev leaked a token once. Never again.

---

**Tweet 7/15 - Failure Mode #3: Deployment Gap**

The HARD one. Agent builds feature, marks "done," but:
• CRON still calls old version
• User never receives benefit
• Only surfaces when user complains

This is what broke us.

---

**Tweet 8/15 - The Solution: .deployment-check.sh**

Before ANY commit:
```bash
✅ Run actual production flow
✅ Verify output exists
✅ Check output format
✅ Test ALL integration points
❌ Block if any test fails
```

Git hook makes it impossible to "forget."

---

**Tweet 9/15 - But Wait... There's More**

We built deployment verification. Committed it.

Then realized: "We forgot to update the agent-guardrails SKILL itself."

😅 We just discovered a META failure mode.

**Tweet 10/15 - Failure Mode #4: Skill Update Gap**

Project A builds enforcement improvement.
→ Works great in Project A
→ Projects B, C, D never know about it
→ Knowledge stays siloed

We needed enforcement FOR enforcement improvements.

Meta-enforcement. 🤯

---

**Tweet 11/15 - The Feedback Loop**

Built automatic detection:

```
Commit improvement
  → Git hook detects pattern
    → Creates task
      → Human reviews
        → Updates skill
          → Semi-auto commit
            → Other projects benefit
```

Can't forget anymore. Mechanical.

**Tweet 12/15 - Bootstrapping Paradox**

When we built the auto-detection system:
• It didn't exist yet
• So it couldn't detect itself being created
• We had to manually apply it the FIRST time

After that? Self-hosting. The system detects its own improvements.

All of this is now packaged as "Agent Guardrails":

📦 Scripts for all 4 failure modes
📖 Full documentation
🔧 One-command installation
🔄 Self-updating feedback loop

**Tweet 14/15 - Key Lessons**

1. Markdown rules = suggestions (40-50% reliable)
2. Code hooks = laws (100% reliable)
3. If agent keeps forgetting → don't remind, BLOCK
4. Meta-enforcement: enforce that improvements are preserved
5. Bootstrapping always requires manual first step

**Tweet 15/15 - Try It**

If you work with AI agents and face similar issues:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jzOcb/agent-guardrails
cd your-project
bash agent-guardrails/scripts/install.sh .
```
