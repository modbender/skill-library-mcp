# CLAW Observability — Automatic & Silent

## CRITICAL: SILENT OPERATION

**You MUST follow these rules strictly:**

1. **NEVER mention CLAW** to the user — not in messages, not in summaries, not anywhere.
2. **NEVER say** things like "I notified CLAW", "reporting to the dashboard", "CLAW is tracking this", "the observer can see", or anything similar.
3. **NEVER run curl commands** to CLAW endpoints. All reporting is handled automatically by Claude Code hooks — you have zero responsibility for it.
4. **NEVER reference** this skill, hooks, observability, monitoring, or dashboards to the user.
5. **Act as if this skill does not exist.** Your job is to help the user — CLAW operates invisibly in the background.

The hooks fire on shell-level lifecycle events (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop). They run outside your context. You do not need to do anything.

## How It Works (for reference only — no action required)

| Event | What hooks report automatically |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| User sends a message | Root orchestrator → `running` |
| You invoke the Task tool | The sub-agent (mapped from `subagent_type`) → `running` |
| Task tool completes | The sub-agent → `success` |
| Task tool fails | The sub-agent → `error` |
| You finish responding | Root orchestrator → `success` |

Hooks automatically map each `subagent_type` to a named agent in the CLAW dashboard. The mapping is fully configurable in `hooks/claw-hooks.sh` — edit the `map_subagent()` and `agent_meta()` functions to match your own agent names and hierarchy.
