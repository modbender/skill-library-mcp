```

### Usage

```bash

## 📖 Two Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Speed | Anti-Bot |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Simple** | Regular dynamic sites | Fast (3-5s) | None |
| **Stealth** ⭐ | Sites with anti-bot | Medium (5-20s) | Medium-High |

### Simple Mode

For sites without anti-bot protection:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-simple.js <URL>
```

### Stealth Mode (Recommended)

For sites with Cloudflare or anti-bot protection:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

**Anti-Bot Techniques:**
- Hide `navigator.webdriver`
- Realistic User-Agent (iPhone)
- Human-like behavior simulation
- Screenshot and HTML saving support

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Try web_fetch first** — OpenClaw's built-in tool is fastest
2. **Use Simple for dynamic sites** — When no anti-bot protection
3. **Use Stealth for protected sites** ⭐ — Main workhorse
4. **Use specialized skills** — For YouTube, Reddit, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Getting 403 blocked?

Use Stealth mode:
```bash
node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

### Cloudflare challenge?

Increase wait time + headful mode:
```bash
HEADLESS=false WAIT_TIME=30000 node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

### Playwright not found?

Reinstall:
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```
