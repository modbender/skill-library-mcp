## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Generate a Code Name

```
You: Generate a code name for our Q2 product launch. Tone: professional but exciting.

AI: CODE NAME OPTIONS:

1. Operation Silver Dawn
   - Silver: Premium, valuable
   - Dawn: New beginning, fresh start
   - Phonetic: SILVER DON

2. Project Velocity Edge
   - Velocity: Speed, momentum
   - Edge: Cutting-edge, advantage
   
3. Operation Horizon Shift
   - Horizon: Future vision
   - Shift: Transformation

Recommendation: "Operation Silver Dawn" - professional, aspirational, memorable.
```

### Example 2: Encode a Secret Message

```
You: I want to send a secret message to my friend: "MEET ME AT THE LIBRARY AT NOON". 
What's a good cipher?

AI: For casual secret-keeping, I recommend Vigenère cipher:

METHOD: Vigenère Cipher
KEY: Choose a keyword you and your friend know (e.g., "FORTRESS")

ENCODING:
Plaintext: MEET ME AT THE LIBRARY AT NOON
Keyword: FORTRESSFORTRESSFORTRE SSFO RT
Ciphertext: RXJG ZR UG GUR VPYKEXI UG ATTR

HOW TO SHARE:
1. Send encrypted message: "RXJG ZR UG GUR VPYKEXI UG ATTR"
2. Share key separately: Tell friend "FORTRESS" in person or via different channel
3. Friend uses keyword to decrypt

DECODING (for your friend):
[Provides step-by-step Vigenère decryption process]
```

### Example 3: Decode a Received Message

```
You: My friend sent me this: "WKLV LV D VHFUHW". They said to use shift 3.

AI: This is a Caesar Cipher with shift 3!

DECODING:
Ciphertext: WKLV LV D VHFUHW
Shift backward by 3:

W → T (shift -3)
K → H (shift -3)
L → I (shift -3)
V → S (shift -3)
...

Plaintext: THIS IS A SECRET

Your friend's message says: "THIS IS A SECRET"
```

### Example 4: Create a Scavenger Hunt

```
You: I'm creating a scavenger hunt. I need 3 encoded clues, progressively harder.

AI: Here's your progressive cipher challenge:

CLUE 1 (Easy - Caesar Shift 5):
Plaintext: LOOK UNDER THE OAK TREE
Ciphertext: QTTP ZSIJW YMJ TPF YWJJ
Key: "Shift 5 forward"

CLUE 2 (Medium - Rail Fence 3 rails):
Plaintext: CHECK THE GARDEN SHED
Ciphertext: CHC TEADE HE GRN SHED
Key: "3 rails, zigzag"

CLUE 3 (Hard - Vigenère):
Plaintext: FINAL PRIZE IN THE MAILBOX
Keyword: TREASURE
Ciphertext: YRLVM TZRLX RL GMX TTRVEBK
Key: "TREASURE"

Participants solve each to get the next key!
```

### Example 5: Layered Security (Hybrid)

```
You: I need maximum security for a message. How do I layer ciphers?

AI: For strong security, use DOUBLE ENCRYPTION:

MESSAGE: "ATTACK AT DAWN"

STEP 1: Vigenère with keyword "FORTRESS"
Result: "FMMPBK PY KPDS"

STEP 2: Rail Fence with 4 rails
Input: FMMPBKPYKPDS
Output: FKYPB MDPMK S

FINAL CIPHERTEXT: "FKYPB MDPMK S"

TO DECODE:
1. Friend reverses Rail Fence (4 rails) → gets "FMMPBKPYKPDS"
2. Friend decrypts Vigenère ("FORTRESS") → gets "ATTACK AT DAWN"

Key sharing: "FORTRESS, then 4 rails" (share in person!)
```
